# Chapter 6: Stocks

Stocks represent ownership in businesses. When you buy a stock, you're not just buying a piece of paper or a digital entry - you're buying a small piece of an actual business with real assets, employees, products, and operations.

---

## What Are Stocks?

A **stock** (also called equity or shares) represents partial ownership in a company. When you own stock, you own a piece of that business and have a claim on its assets and earnings.

### Stocks Are Businesses

#### Understanding Business Ownership
When you buy shares of Apple, you own a tiny piece of:
- **Physical assets**: Buildings, equipment, inventory
- **Intellectual property**: Patents, trademarks, software
- **Human capital**: Employees and their expertise
- **Business operations**: Manufacturing, sales, research & development
- **Financial assets**: Cash, investments, accounts receivable

#### Example: Owning McDonald's Stock
If you own 100 shares of McDonald's:
- You own a fraction of **40,000+ restaurants** worldwide
- You own part of the **McDonald's brand** and trademarks
- You own a piece of **real estate** (many locations are owned, not leased)
- You own part of **supply chain operations**
- You have a claim on **future profits** from burger sales

### Types of Stock Ownership

#### Common Stock
- **Voting rights**: Elect board of directors, vote on major decisions
- **Dividend rights**: Receive dividends when declared
- **Residual claims**: Last to be paid if company liquidates
- **Capital appreciation**: Benefit from stock price increases

#### Preferred Stock
- **Fixed dividends**: Usually receive dividends before common shareholders
- **Limited voting rights**: Typically no voting power
- **Priority in liquidation**: Paid before common shareholders
- **Less price volatility**: More stable than common stock

## How Businesses Make Money and Pay Dividends

### Business Revenue and Profit Generation

#### The Business Profit Process:
1. **Generate Revenue**: Sell products or services to customers
2. **Pay Operating Expenses**: Salaries, rent, materials, marketing
3. **Calculate Operating Income**: Revenue minus operating expenses
4. **Pay Interest and Taxes**: Service debt and pay government taxes
5. **Net Income**: What's left after all expenses

#### Business Income Example:
**Tech Company Annual Financials:**
- **Revenue**: \$1 billion (from software sales)
- **Operating Expenses**: \$600 million
- **Operating Income**: \$400 million
- **Interest Expense**: \$50 million
- **Taxes**: \$100 million
- **Net Income**: \$250 million

### What Companies Do with Profits

When businesses make money, they have several options:

#### 1. Pay Dividends to Shareholders
- **Cash dividends**: Direct cash payments to shareholders
- **Dividend yield**: Annual dividends divided by stock price
- **Payout ratio**: Percentage of earnings paid as dividends

#### 2. Reinvest in the Business
- **Research and development**: Create new products
- **Expansion**: Build new facilities, enter new markets
- **Equipment upgrades**: Improve efficiency and capacity
- **Acquisitions**: Buy other companies

#### 3. Buy Back Shares
- **Share repurchases**: Company buys its own stock
- **Reduces share count**: Increases ownership percentage for remaining shareholders
- **Alternative to dividends**: Returns cash to shareholders indirectly

#### 4. Build Cash Reserves
- **Emergency fund**: Prepare for economic downturns
- **Future opportunities**: Save for strategic investments
- **Financial flexibility**: Maintain strong balance sheet

### Understanding Dividends

#### How Dividends Work
Dividends are **distributions of company profits** to shareholders. They represent your share of the business's success.

#### Dividend Payment Process:
1. **Company earns profits** during the quarter/year
2. **Board of directors** decides whether to pay dividends
3. **Dividend declared** with specific amount and payment date
4. **Ex-dividend date**: Last day to buy stock and receive dividend
5. **Payment date**: Dividends deposited to shareholder accounts

#### Dividend Example:
**Coca-Cola Dividend Payment:**
- **Quarterly dividend**: \$0.44 per share
- **Annual dividend**: \$1.76 per share
- **If you own 100 shares**: Receive \$176 annually
- **Payment schedule**: Four quarterly payments of \$44 each

#### Dividend Yield Calculation:
$$\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividend per Share}}{\text{Current Stock Price}} \times 100\%$$

**Example:**
- **Annual dividend**: \$2.00 per share
- **Current stock price**: \$50
- **Dividend yield**: \$2.00 รท \$50 = 4%

### Dividend Policy Variations

#### High-Dividend Companies
- **Mature businesses**: Established companies with stable cash flows
- **Utilities**: Electric, gas, water companies
- **Consumer staples**: Food, beverage, household products
- **Typical yields**: 3-6%

#### Low/No-Dividend Companies
- **Growth companies**: Reinvest profits for expansion
- **Technology firms**: Focus on research and development
- **Young companies**: Need cash for business development
- **Typical yields**: 0-2%

#### Dividend Growth Companies
- **Consistent increases**: Raise dividends annually
- **Dividend aristocrats**: Companies with 25+ years of dividend increases
- **Balanced approach**: Pay dividends while growing business

## Key Risks of Stock Investing

### 1. Business Risk

**Business risk** is the fundamental risk that the company's business may fail or perform poorly.

#### Types of Business Risk:

**Operational Risk:**
- **Competition**: New competitors or existing ones gaining market share
- **Technology disruption**: New technologies making products obsolete
- **Management decisions**: Poor strategic choices or execution
- **Product failures**: Products that don't meet market needs

**Industry Risk:**
- **Cyclical industries**: Construction, automotive, airlines face economic cycles
- **Regulatory changes**: Healthcare, finance, energy face regulatory shifts
- **Commodity dependence**: Mining, oil companies affected by commodity prices
- **Consumer preference shifts**: Fashion, food companies face changing tastes

#### Business Risk Examples:

**Kodak (Photography):**
- **Traditional business**: Film photography leader for decades
- **Digital disruption**: Digital cameras and smartphones eliminated film demand
- **Failed adaptation**: Couldn't successfully transition to digital
- **Result**: Stock fell from \$80+ to bankruptcy

**Blockbuster (Video Rental):**
- **Traditional business**: Physical video rental stores
- **Streaming disruption**: Netflix and online streaming
- **Missed opportunities**: Rejected chance to buy Netflix
- **Result**: From \$30+ stock to bankruptcy

### 2. Market Risk

**Market risk** affects all stocks regardless of individual company performance.

#### Sources of Market Risk:

**Economic Factors:**
- **Recessions**: Economic downturns reduce corporate profits
- **Interest rate changes**: Affect borrowing costs and investment alternatives
- **Inflation**: Erodes purchasing power and increases costs
- **Currency fluctuations**: Impact international businesses

**Market Sentiment:**
- **Investor psychology**: Fear and greed drive market movements
- **Market bubbles**: Overvaluation followed by crashes
- **Panic selling**: Emotional reactions cause widespread selling
- **Herd behavior**: Following crowd rather than fundamentals

#### Market Risk Example:
**2008 Financial Crisis:**
- **S&P 500 decline**: Fell 57% from peak to trough
- **Quality companies affected**: Even strong businesses saw stock prices fall
- **Apple stock**: Fell from \$28 to \$12 despite strong iPhone sales
- **Recovery**: Took several years for markets to recover

### 3. Liquidity Risk

**Liquidity risk** is the risk that you cannot sell your stock quickly at a fair price.

#### Liquidity Factors:

**Trading Volume:**
- **High volume stocks**: Easy to buy/sell with minimal price impact
- **Low volume stocks**: Difficult to trade without affecting price
- **Market makers**: Provide liquidity but may widen spreads during stress

**Market Conditions:**
- **Normal markets**: Most stocks trade easily
- **Crisis periods**: Liquidity can disappear quickly
- **After-hours trading**: Reduced liquidity outside market hours

#### Liquidity Risk Example:
**Small Company Stock:**
- **Daily volume**: Only 1,000 shares traded daily
- **Your holding**: 10,000 shares (10 days of normal volume)
- **Selling pressure**: Attempting to sell quickly drives price down
- **Result**: May need to accept lower price or sell gradually

### 4. Volatility Risk

**Volatility risk** refers to the unpredictable price swings that stocks experience.

#### Sources of Volatility:

**Company-Specific News:**
- **Earnings announcements**: Quarterly results vs. expectations
- **Product launches**: Success or failure of new products
- **Management changes**: CEO departures, strategic shifts
- **Legal issues**: Lawsuits, regulatory investigations

**Market-Wide Events:**
- **Economic data**: GDP, employment, inflation reports
- **Geopolitical events**: Wars, trade disputes, political changes
- **Natural disasters**: Hurricanes, pandemics, earthquakes

#### Volatility Example:
**Netflix Stock (2022):**
- **January**: \$610 per share
- **Subscriber loss**: First quarterly subscriber decline
- **July**: \$162 per share (73% decline)
- **Recovery**: Partial recovery to \$300+ by year-end
- **Lesson**: Even successful companies can be highly volatile

### 5. The Difficulty of Stock Picking

**Stock picking** - choosing individual stocks that will outperform the market - is extremely challenging, even for professionals.

#### Why Stock Picking is Hard:

**Information Disadvantage:**
- **Professional analysts**: Full-time researchers with advanced tools
- **Institutional investors**: Access to company management and industry experts
- **Information speed**: News and data reach professionals first
- **Resource constraints**: Individual investors lack time and resources

**Market Efficiency:**
- **Price discovery**: Stock prices quickly reflect available information
- **Competition**: Thousands of smart investors analyzing same companies
- **Arbitrage**: Price discrepancies quickly eliminated
- **Random walk**: Short-term price movements appear random

#### Professional Performance Statistics:

**Mutual Fund Performance:**
- **Underperformance**: 80-90% of actively managed funds underperform market indexes
- **Persistence**: Past performance doesn't predict future results
- **Costs**: Management fees reduce returns further
- **Survivorship bias**: Poor-performing funds close, skewing statistics

**Individual Investor Performance:**
- **Behavioral biases**: Emotional decisions hurt returns
- **Timing mistakes**: Buy high during euphoria, sell low during panic
- **Overconfidence**: Believe they can beat professionals
- **Transaction costs**: Frequent trading increases costs

#### Common Stock Picking Mistakes:

**1. Overconfidence Bias:**
- **Illusion of knowledge**: Feeling informed after reading news
- **Past success**: Attributing lucky picks to skill
- **Overtrading**: Making too many transactions

**2. Confirmation Bias:**
- **Selective information**: Only seeking information that confirms beliefs
- **Ignoring negatives**: Dismissing bad news about owned stocks
- **Echo chambers**: Following sources that agree with you

**3. Recency Bias:**
- **Recent performance**: Assuming recent trends will continue
- **Hot sectors**: Chasing last year's winning industries
- **Momentum investing**: Buying stocks that have already risen

**4. Loss Aversion:**
- **Holding losers**: Reluctant to realize losses
- **Selling winners**: Taking profits too quickly
- **Anchoring**: Fixating on purchase price

#### The Random Walk Problem:

**Stock Price Movements:**
- **Short-term randomness**: Daily/weekly movements appear random
- **Unpredictable events**: Company and market surprises
- **Noise vs. signal**: Distinguishing meaningful information from noise
- **Timing challenge**: Even correct analysis may have wrong timing

**Example of Randomness:**
- **Company analysis**: Thorough research suggests stock should rise
- **Unexpected event**: Regulatory change affects entire industry
- **Result**: Stock falls despite correct fundamental analysis
- **Lesson**: Even good analysis can't predict all variables

### 6. Concentration Risk

**Concentration risk** occurs when too much of your portfolio is invested in a single stock or sector.

#### Types of Concentration Risk:

**Single Stock Concentration:**
- **Company-specific events**: One bad quarter can devastate portfolio
- **Lack of diversification**: All eggs in one basket
- **Emotional attachment**: Difficulty selling stocks you "believe in"

**Sector Concentration:**
- **Industry downturns**: Entire sectors can decline together
- **Technology bubble (2000)**: Tech stocks fell 70-80%
- **Financial crisis (2008)**: Bank stocks collapsed together

#### Concentration Risk Example:
**Enron Employee 401(k):**
- **Company stock**: 60% of retirement funds in Enron stock
- **Company collapse**: Accounting fraud revealed
- **Employee losses**: Lost jobs and retirement savings simultaneously
- **Lesson**: Don't concentrate in employer stock

## Why Stock Picking is Particularly Challenging

### The Professional Competition

#### Who You're Competing Against:

**Institutional Investors:**
- **Pension funds**: Managing billions with large research teams
- **Hedge funds**: Using sophisticated strategies and technology
- **Mutual funds**: Professional portfolio managers with decades of experience
- **Investment banks**: Analysts with direct company access

**Technology and Resources:**
- **Bloomberg terminals**: \$24,000+ annual cost for professional data
- **Algorithmic trading**: Computer programs executing trades in milliseconds
- **Satellite data**: Tracking retail foot traffic, crop yields, oil storage
- **Alternative data**: Social media sentiment, credit card transactions

#### Information Asymmetry:

**Professional Advantages:**
- **Company meetings**: Direct access to management teams
- **Industry conferences**: Networking with competitors and suppliers
- **Expert networks**: Consulting with former employees and industry experts
- **Research budgets**: Millions spent on analysis and data

**Individual Investor Limitations:**
- **Public information**: Only access to publicly available data
- **Time constraints**: Limited hours for research
- **Resource limitations**: Can't afford professional-grade tools
- **Experience gap**: Less experience analyzing companies

### The Efficient Market Challenge

#### How Markets Process Information:

**Speed of Information:**
- **Millisecond reactions**: Algorithms react to news instantly
- **Global markets**: 24/7 information flow across time zones
- **Social media**: News spreads faster than ever
- **High-frequency trading**: Thousands of trades per second

**Price Discovery Process:**
- **Continuous analysis**: Thousands of professionals analyzing each stock
- **Immediate adjustment**: Prices adjust quickly to new information
- **Arbitrage elimination**: Price discrepancies quickly corrected
- **Collective wisdom**: Market prices reflect consensus of all participants

#### Market Efficiency Example:
**Earnings Announcement:**
- **Before announcement**: Stock trades at \$50
- **Earnings released**: Better than expected at 4:00 PM
- **After-hours trading**: Stock jumps to \$55 within minutes
- **Next day opening**: Gap up already reflects new information
- **Lesson**: By the time you hear news, it's often already priced in

### Behavioral Challenges

#### Emotional Decision Making:

**Fear and Greed Cycle:**
- **Bull markets**: Overconfidence leads to risky decisions
- **Bear markets**: Fear causes selling at worst times
- **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**: Chasing hot stocks
- **Panic selling**: Emotional reactions to market volatility

**Cognitive Biases:**
- **Hindsight bias**: Believing past events were predictable
- **Availability bias**: Overweighting recent or memorable events
- **Anchoring bias**: Fixating on irrelevant reference points
- **Herd mentality**: Following crowd rather than independent analysis

#### The Paradox of Choice:

**Too Many Options:**
- **Thousands of stocks**: Overwhelming number of choices
- **Analysis paralysis**: Too much information to process
- **Decision fatigue**: Quality of decisions deteriorates
- **Opportunity cost**: Time spent analyzing one stock means missing others

## Chapter Summary

Stocks represent ownership in real businesses with several key characteristics:

1. **Business ownership**: Stocks give you a claim on company assets and earnings
2. **Dividend income**: Companies may distribute profits to shareholders
3. **Multiple risks**: Business, market, liquidity, volatility, and concentration risks
4. **Stock picking difficulty**: Competing against professionals with superior resources
5. **Market efficiency**: Prices quickly reflect available information
6. **Behavioral challenges**: Emotions and biases hurt investment decisions
7. **Alternative approaches**: Index funds and professional management options

Understanding these concepts helps investors make informed decisions about stock investing. While stocks can provide excellent long-term returns, the challenges of individual stock selection suggest that most investors benefit from diversified approaches rather than trying to pick individual winners.

:::tip Investment Consideration
Stock picking is extremely difficult, even for professionals. Most individual investors achieve better results through diversified index funds rather than trying to select individual stocks. Focus on broad market exposure, low costs, and long-term investing rather than attempting to beat the market through stock selection.
