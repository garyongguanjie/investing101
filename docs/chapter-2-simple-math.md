# Chapter 2: Simple Math of Investing

## Compounding

Compounding is the process where your investment earnings generate their own earnings over time. This creates a snowball effect where your money grows exponentially rather than linearly.

### Why Compounding Matters

The power of compounding lies in time and consistency. Even small amounts invested regularly can grow into substantial sums over long periods due to the compounding effect.

## Rule of 72

The Rule of 72 is a quick mental calculation to estimate how long it will take for your money to double at a given interest rate.

### How It Works

Simply divide 72 by your annual interest rate to get the approximate number of years needed to double your investment.

## Key Formulas

### Future Value Formula
```
Future Value = Present Value × (1 + r)^t
```

Where:
- **Present Value** = Initial investment amount
- **r** = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
- **t** = Number of years

### Rule of 72 Formula
```
Years to Double ≈ 72 ÷ Interest Rate (%)
```

**Example:** At 8% annual return, your money will double in approximately 72 ÷ 8 = 9 years.

## Understanding Yield Differentials

When comparing investment yields, it's crucial to understand that the difference between yields represents a **relative percentage increase**, not an absolute difference.

### The Math Behind Yield Comparisons

Consider two investments with different yields:
- Investment A: 2% yield
- Investment B: 4% yield

Many investors incorrectly think this is just a "2% difference." However, the correct way to calculate the difference is:

$$\text{Relative Difference} = \frac{\text{Higher Yield} - \text{Lower Yield}}{\text{Lower Yield}} \times 100\%$$

$$\text{Relative Difference} = \frac{4\% - 2\%}{2\%} \times 100\% = \frac{2\%}{2\%} \times 100\% = 100\%$$

**Investment B provides 100% more income than Investment A**, not just 2% more.

### Real Estate Example: Property Rental Yields

Let's examine a concrete example using a \$1,000,000 rental property:

**Scenario 1: 2% Annual Yield**
- Property Value: \$1,000,000
- Annual Rental Income: $$\$1,000,000 \times 2\% = \$20,000$$


**Scenario 2: 4% Annual Yield** 
- Property Value: \$1,000,000
- Annual Rental Income: $$\$1,000,000 \times 4\% = \$40,000$$

**The Key Insight:**
The 4% yield property generates **twice** the rental income (\$40,000 vs \$20,000). This \$20,000 additional annual income represents a 100% increase in cash flow.

### Why This Matters for Investors

Understanding yield differentials is critical because:

1. **Cash Flow Impact**: Higher yields dramatically increase your income stream
2. **Opportunity Cost**: Choosing lower-yield investments means sacrificing significant income
3. **Investment Selection**: Small yield differences compound into large income differences over time

**Remember**: When evaluating yields, think in terms of **relative percentage increases** rather than absolute differences. Your money needs to work as efficiently as possible.

## Why Compounding Beats Trading

### The Compounding Advantage

Long-term investing with compounding offers several advantages over frequent trading:

1. **Exponential Growth**: Compounding creates exponential growth over time, while trading typically produces only small, linear gains
2. **Lower Costs**: Buy-and-hold strategies minimize transaction costs
3. **Time in Market**: Staying invested allows you to capture the full power of compounding

### The Trading Trap

Frequent trading faces significant obstacles:

- **Transaction Costs**: Even with low commission rates (e.g., 0.2% per trade), costs add up quickly
- **No Compounding**: Trading profits don't compound effectively since positions are frequently closed
- **Timing Risk**: Difficult to consistently time market movements

### Real Example: The Cost of Trading

Consider this scenario:
- **Annual Return Target**: 8%
- **Trading Commission**: 0.2% per buy/sell transaction (0.4% round trip)
- **Trading Frequency**: 10 round trips per year

**The Math:**
- Total trading costs: 10 × 0.4% = 4% per year
- Net return needed from trades: 8% + 4% = 12% just to break even with a simple 8% buy-and-hold strategy

This means you need to achieve 50% higher returns just to match the performance of a simple compounding strategy, before even considering the additional risks and time commitment of active trading.

### The Bottom Line

Compounding rewards patience and consistency. While trading might seem exciting, the mathematical reality is that transaction costs and the lack of true compounding make it extremely difficult to outperform a simple, long-term investment approach.

**Key Takeaway**: Time in the market beats timing the market.
