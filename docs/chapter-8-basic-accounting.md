# Chapter 8: Basic Accounting

Understanding basic accounting is essential for analyzing stocks and REITs effectively. Financial statements tell the story of a company's financial health, and knowing how to read them gives you the tools to make informed investment decisions. This chapter covers the fundamental accounting concepts that are essential for effective security analysis.

## Why Accounting Matters for Investors

### The Language of Business

**Accounting** is often called "the language of business" because it provides a standardized way to measure and communicate a company's financial performance and position.

#### What Accounting Tells Investors:
- **Financial health**: Is the company financially stable?
- **Profitability**: How much money does the company make?
- **Growth trends**: Is the business growing or declining?
- **Risk assessment**: What are the potential financial risks?
- **Valuation basis**: What is the company actually worth?

#### Value Investing Approach:
Successful investing requires a disciplined, analytical approach that emphasizes:
- **Quantitative analysis**: Using numbers to evaluate companies objectively
- **Financial statement analysis**: Understanding what the numbers really mean
- **Margin of safety**: Buying below intrinsic value based on financial data
- **Conservative estimates**: Being cautious with financial projections

### The Three Core Financial Statements

Every public company must publish three main financial statements that work together to tell the complete financial story:

1. **Balance Sheet**: What the company owns and owes at a specific point in time
2. **Income Statement**: How much the company earned and spent over a period
3. **Cash Flow Statement**: How cash moved in and out of the business

---

## The Balance Sheet

The **balance sheet** provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific date. It shows what the company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and what belongs to shareholders (equity).

### The Fundamental Accounting Equation

The balance sheet is built on the most important equation in accounting:

$$\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Shareholders' Equity}$$

This equation must always balance, which is why it's called a "balance" sheet.

#### Rearranging the Equation:
$$\text{Shareholders' Equity} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}$$

This shows that shareholders' equity represents the residual value after paying off all debts.

### Assets: What the Company Owns

**Assets** are resources owned by the company that have economic value and can generate future benefits.

#### Current Assets

**Current assets** are assets that can be converted to cash within one year or one operating cycle.

##### Types of Current Assets:

**1. Cash and Cash Equivalents**
- **Cash**: Money in bank accounts
- **Cash equivalents**: Short-term investments easily converted to cash
- **Examples**: Treasury bills, money market funds, commercial paper
- **Importance**: Provides liquidity and financial flexibility

**2. Accounts Receivable**
- **Definition**: Money owed by customers for goods/services already delivered
- **Collection period**: Usually 30-90 days
- **Quality concern**: Some receivables may not be collected
- **Allowance**: Companies estimate uncollectible amounts

**3. Inventory**
- **Raw materials**: Components used in production
- **Work-in-progress**: Partially completed products
- **Finished goods**: Completed products ready for sale
- **Valuation methods**: FIFO, LIFO, weighted average

**4. Prepaid Expenses**
- **Definition**: Payments made in advance for future benefits
- **Examples**: Prepaid rent, insurance, advertising
- **Conversion**: Become expenses as benefits are received

**5. Short-term Investments**
- **Marketable securities**: Stocks, bonds held for less than one year
- **Purpose**: Earn returns on excess cash
- **Liquidity**: Can be sold quickly if cash is needed

#### Current Assets Example:
**ABC Manufacturing Company Current Assets:**
- **Cash and equivalents**: \$5,000,000
- **Accounts receivable**: \$12,000,000
- **Inventory**: \$8,000,000
- **Prepaid expenses**: \$1,000,000
- **Short-term investments**: \$2,000,000
- **Total current assets**: \$28,000,000

#### Non-Current Assets (Fixed Assets)

**Non-current assets** are long-term assets that provide benefits for more than one year.

##### Types of Non-Current Assets:

**1. Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)**
- **Land**: Real estate owned by the company
- **Buildings**: Factories, offices, warehouses
- **Machinery**: Production equipment, vehicles
- **Depreciation**: Gradual reduction in value over time

**2. Intangible Assets**
- **Patents**: Exclusive rights to inventions
- **Trademarks**: Brand names and logos
- **Copyrights**: Creative works protection
- **Goodwill**: Premium paid in acquisitions
- **Software**: Computer programs and systems

**3. Long-term Investments**
- **Subsidiary investments**: Ownership in other companies
- **Real estate investments**: Properties held for investment
- **Long-term securities**: Bonds and stocks held long-term

#### PP&E Depreciation Calculation:
$$\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}$$

**Example:**
- **Equipment cost**: \$100,000
- **Salvage value**: \$10,000
- **Useful life**: 10 years
- **Annual depreciation**: (\$100,000 - \$10,000) รท 10 = \$9,000

### Liabilities: What the Company Owes

**Liabilities** are obligations that the company must pay to others.

#### Current Liabilities

**Current liabilities** are debts that must be paid within one year.

##### Types of Current Liabilities:

**1. Accounts Payable**
- **Definition**: Money owed to suppliers for goods/services received
- **Payment terms**: Usually 30-60 days
- **Management**: Companies try to extend payment periods to improve cash flow

**2. Short-term Debt**
- **Bank loans**: Credit lines and short-term borrowings
- **Commercial paper**: Short-term corporate IOUs
- **Current portion of long-term debt**: Long-term debt due within one year

**3. Accrued Expenses**
- **Wages payable**: Employee compensation earned but not yet paid
- **Interest payable**: Interest owed on loans
- **Taxes payable**: Income taxes owed to government
- **Utilities payable**: Electricity, water, phone bills

**4. Unearned Revenue**
- **Definition**: Cash received for goods/services not yet delivered
- **Examples**: Magazine subscriptions, software licenses, gift cards
- **Recognition**: Becomes revenue when goods/services are delivered

#### Current Liabilities Example:
**ABC Manufacturing Company Current Liabilities:**
- **Accounts payable**: \$6,000,000
- **Short-term debt**: \$3,000,000
- **Accrued expenses**: \$2,500,000
- **Unearned revenue**: \$1,500,000
- **Total current liabilities**: \$13,000,000

#### Non-Current Liabilities (Long-term Liabilities)

**Non-current liabilities** are debts that don't need to be paid within one year.

##### Types of Non-Current Liabilities:

**1. Long-term Debt**
- **Corporate bonds**: Debt securities issued to investors
- **Bank loans**: Multi-year borrowing agreements
- **Mortgages**: Real estate-secured loans
- **Interest rates**: Fixed or variable rates

**2. Pension Obligations**
- **Defined benefit plans**: Company promises specific retirement benefits
- **Actuarial calculations**: Complex estimates of future obligations
- **Funding status**: Whether plan assets cover obligations

**3. Deferred Tax Liabilities**
- **Timing differences**: When accounting and tax rules differ
- **Future payments**: Taxes that will be owed in future years

### Shareholders' Equity: What Belongs to Owners

**Shareholders' equity** represents the owners' residual interest in the company after all liabilities are paid.

#### Components of Shareholders' Equity:

**1. Common Stock**

Common Stock represents the ownership shares of a company held by investors. It's listed on the balance sheet at its `par value`, which is a nominal value assigned to the shares, often very low, and has little relation to the market price.

- **Par value**: A nominal, often symbolic, value assigned to each share. Historically, it represented legal capital for creditor protection, but today, it's largely an accounting formality. Many modern companies issue "no-par" or very low par value stock (e.g., \$0.01 per share).
- **Shares outstanding**: The total number of shares currently owned by investors.
- **Market value**: The current trading price of the shares on an exchange, which fluctuates based on market demand, company performance, and other factors, and is distinct from the par value.

*Simplified Explanation:* Think of `Common Stock` (in terms of its par value on the balance sheet) as a tiny, almost symbolic "label price" printed on each share, like \$0.01. It's an old-fashioned legal requirement and doesn't tell you much about the stock's real economic worth today.

**2. Additional Paid-in Capital (APIC)**

**Definition**: This represents the amount of money investors have paid for a company's shares *over and above* the shares' par value. When a company issues stock, the actual price paid by investors is usually much higher than the nominal par value.

- **Example**: If a share has a par value of \$1 but investors paid \$20 for it, the `Additional Paid-in Capital` for that share would be \$19.
- **Accounting Treatment**: The \$1 would be recorded under `Common Stock` (at par) and the \$19 would be recorded under `Additional Paid-in Capital`.

*Simplified Explanation:* If investors pay, say, \$10 for a share that has a \$0.01 "label price" (par value), the extra \$9.99 per share goes into `Additional Paid-in Capital`. This account captures the **actual extra money** that investors paid into the company directly when they bought newly issued shares, beyond that tiny symbolic par value.

Together, `Common Stock` (par value portion) and `Additional Paid-in Capital` represent the total capital (`total amount of cash or assets`) the company has received directly from its shareholders when it initially sold them stock.

**Important Note on Capital Generation:** This capital (from Common Stock and Additional Paid-in Capital) is generated only when the company issues new shares directly to investors. This primarily occurs during:
- **Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)**: The very first time a company offers its shares for sale to the general public.
- **Rights Issues**: When a company offers existing shareholders the right to buy new shares, usually at a discount.

It's crucial to understand that buying and selling of existing shares on the stock market (secondary market trading) does **not** add new capital to the company. When an investor buys shares from another investor on the stock market, the money changes hands between those two investors, not the company itself.

**3. Retained Earnings**
- **Definition**: Cumulative profits kept in the business
- **Calculation**: All-time profits minus all-time dividends paid
- **Growth**: Increases when company is profitable and retains earnings

#### Retained Earnings Calculation:
$$\text{Ending Retained Earnings} = \text{Beginning Retained Earnings} + \text{Net Income} - \text{Dividends Paid}$$

**Example:**
- **Beginning retained earnings**: \$50,000,000
- **Net income for year**: \$8,000,000
- **Dividends paid**: \$3,000,000
- **Ending retained earnings**: \$50,000,000 + \$8,000,000 - \$3,000,000 = \$55,000,000

#### Using Retained Earnings for Reinvestment

**What happens when companies reinvest retained earnings:**

When a company uses retained earnings to reinvest in itself, the money doesn't disappearโit transforms from cash into other assets that can generate future profits.

**Common reinvestment uses:**

**1. Capital Expenditures (CapEx)**
- **New equipment**: Purchasing machinery to increase production capacity
- **Technology upgrades**: Investing in software, computers, or automation
- **Facility expansion**: Building new factories, offices, or warehouses
- **Accounting impact**: Cash decreases, PP&E (Property, Plant & Equipment) increases

**2. Research & Development**
- **Product development**: Creating new products or improving existing ones
- **Innovation**: Investing in new technologies or processes
- **Accounting impact**: Cash decreases, R&D expense increases (reducing current profits but potentially increasing future profits)

**3. Acquisitions**
- **Buying other companies**: Expanding market share or capabilities
- **Strategic investments**: Purchasing stakes in suppliers or partners
- **Accounting impact**: Cash decreases, goodwill and other assets increase

**4. Working Capital Investment**
- **Inventory buildup**: Stocking more products to support growth
- **Extended credit terms**: Allowing customers longer payment periods
- **Accounting impact**: Cash decreases, inventory or accounts receivable increases

#### Reinvestment Example:

**ABC Manufacturing decides to reinvest \$10 million in retained earnings:**

**Before reinvestment:**
- **Cash**: \$15,000,000
- **PP&E**: \$30,000,000
- **Retained earnings**: \$55,000,000

**After purchasing new equipment for \$10 million:**
- **Cash**: \$5,000,000 (decreased by \$10M)
- **PP&E**: \$40,000,000 (increased by \$10M)
- **Retained earnings**: \$55,000,000 (unchanged)

**Key insight**: Total assets remain the same, but the composition changes from liquid cash to productive assets.

#### Why Reinvestment Matters for Investors:

**1. Growth Potential**
- **Increased capacity**: More equipment can produce more goods
- **Higher efficiency**: New technology can reduce costs
- **Market expansion**: New facilities can serve more customers

**2. Future Profitability**
- **Revenue growth**: Better assets can generate more sales
- **Cost reduction**: Efficient equipment lowers production costs
- **Competitive advantage**: Innovation can differentiate the company

**3. Return on Investment**
- **ROA improvement**: If new assets generate profits exceeding their cost
- **ROE enhancement**: Higher profits with same equity base
- **Compound growth**: Reinvested profits can generate even more profits

#### Evaluating Reinvestment Quality:

**Good reinvestment signs:**
- **Rising revenue**: New investments lead to higher sales
- **Improving margins**: Efficiency gains reduce costs
- **Market share growth**: Investments help compete better
- **Consistent ROA/ROE**: Returns remain strong despite asset growth

**Poor reinvestment signs:**
- **Declining returns**: ROA/ROE fall as assets grow
- **Excess capacity**: Investments don't generate expected revenue
- **Technology obsolescence**: Investments become outdated quickly
- **Market saturation**: No demand for increased capacity

#### Reinvestment vs. Dividends Trade-off:

**Companies must choose between:**

**Paying dividends:**
- **Immediate return**: Shareholders receive cash now
- **Steady income**: Predictable payments for income-focused investors
- **Limited growth**: Less money available for expansion

**Reinvesting earnings:**
- **Future growth**: Potential for higher stock prices
- **Compound returns**: Profits can generate more profits
- **Risk**: Investments might not succeed

**Optimal strategy depends on:**
- **Growth opportunities**: High-return projects favor reinvestment
- **Market maturity**: Mature markets may favor dividends
- **Management skill**: Ability to deploy capital effectively
- **Shareholder preferences**: Income vs. growth orientation

## The Income Statement

The **income statement** (also called profit & loss statement) shows a company's revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period (quarter or year).

### Income Statement Structure

#### Revenue (Top Line)
**Revenue** is the money a company earns from its primary business activities.

##### Types of Revenue:
- **Product sales**: Revenue from selling goods
- **Service revenue**: Revenue from providing services
- **Subscription revenue**: Recurring revenue from subscriptions
- **Licensing revenue**: Revenue from licensing intellectual property

#### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
**COGS** represents the direct costs of producing goods or services sold.

##### Components of COGS:
- **Raw materials**: Direct materials used in production
- **Direct labor**: Wages of workers directly involved in production
- **Manufacturing overhead**: Factory rent, utilities, equipment depreciation

#### Gross Profit
$$\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold}$$

#### Gross Profit Margin
$$\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100\%$$

#### Operating Expenses
**Operating expenses** are costs of running the business that aren't directly tied to production.

##### Types of Operating Expenses:
- **Selling expenses**: Sales commissions, advertising, marketing
- **General & administrative**: Management salaries, office rent, legal fees
- **Research & development**: Product development and innovation costs
- **Depreciation**: Allocation of asset costs over time

#### Operating Income (EBIT)
$$\text{Operating Income} = \text{Gross Profit} - \text{Operating Expenses}$$

**EBIT** stands for "Earnings Before Interest and Taxes."

#### EBITDA
$$\text{EBITDA} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Interest} + \text{Taxes} + \text{Depreciation} + \text{Amortization}$$

**EBITDA** stands for "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization."

**Why EBITDA matters**: It shows operating performance excluding non-cash expenses (depreciation/amortization) and financing decisions (interest/taxes).

#### Other Income
**Other income** includes non-operating revenues and gains that are not part of the company's core business activities.

##### Types of Other Income:
- **Investment income**: Interest and dividends from investments
- **Gain on asset sales**: Profits from selling property or equipment
- **Foreign exchange gains**: Currency translation gains
- **Rental income**: Income from leasing unused facilities

#### Net Income (Bottom Line)
$$\text{Net Income} = \text{Operating Income} + \text{Other Income} - \text{Interest Expense} - \text{Taxes}$$

| **Net Income** | **\$7,875,000** |

#### Key Margin Calculations:
- **Gross profit margin**: \$40M รท \$100M = 40%
- **EBITDA margin**: \$15.5M รท \$100M = 15.5%
- **Operating margin**: \$12M รท \$100M = 12%
- **Net profit margin**: \$7.875M รท \$100M = 7.875%

#### EBITDA Calculation:
$$\text{EBITDA} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Interest} + \text{Taxes} + \text{Depreciation} + \text{Amortization}$$
$$\text{EBITDA} = \$7,875,000 + \$2,000,000 + \$2,625,000 + \$3,000,000 + \$0 = \$15,500,000$$

**Alternative calculation (from Operating Income):**
$$\text{EBITDA} = \text{Operating Income} + \text{Other Income} + \text{Depreciation} + \text{Amortization}$$
$$\text{EBITDA} = \$12,000,000 + \$500,000 + \$3,000,000 + \$0 = \$15,500,000$$

## Key Financial Ratios for Security Analysis

Financial ratios help investors analyze and compare companies by standardizing financial statement data.

### Liquidity Ratios

**Liquidity ratios** measure a company's ability to pay short-term obligations.

#### Current Ratio
$$\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\$28,000,000}{\$13,000,000} = 2.15$$

**Interpretation:**
- **Above 1.0**: Company can cover current liabilities
- **1.5-3.0**: Generally considered healthy
- **Too high**: May indicate inefficient use of assets

#### Quick Ratio (Acid Test)
$$\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\$28,000,000 - \$8,000,000}{\$13,000,000} = 1.54$$

**Purpose**: More conservative than current ratio because inventory may be hard to convert to cash quickly.

#### Cash Ratio
$$\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash + Cash Equivalents}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\$5,000,000}{\$13,000,000} = 0.38$$

**Purpose**: Most conservative liquidity measure using only cash.

### Sector-Specific Financial Ratio Benchmarks

Different industries have varying business models, capital requirements, and operational characteristics that result in different "normal" ranges for financial ratios. Understanding these sector-specific benchmarks helps investors identify financially strong companies within their respective industries and spot potential red flags.

#### Current Ratio Benchmarks

| Sector | Strong | Acceptable | Weak | Key Characteristics |
|--------|--------|------------|------|-------------------|
| **Technology - Software** | > 3.0 | 2.0-3.0 | < 1.5 | Asset-light, minimal inventory, strong cash generation |
| **Technology - Hardware** | > 2.5 | 1.8-2.5 | < 1.3 | Inventory cycles, working capital needs |
| **Healthcare - Pharmaceuticals** | > 3.0 | 2.5-3.0 | < 2.0 | Strong cash flows, R&D investments |
| **Healthcare - Biotech** | > 4.0 | 3.0-4.0 | < 2.0 | High cash burn, uncertain revenue timing |
| **Financial Services - Banks** | > 1.2 | 1.0-1.2 | < 0.9 | Different liquidity measures more relevant |

| **Consumer Staples** | > 2.0 | 1.5-2.0 | < 1.2 | Stable demand, predictable inventory |
| **Consumer Discretionary** | > 2.5 | 1.8-2.5 | < 1.4 | Seasonal patterns, economic sensitivity |
| **Industrials** | > 2.2 | 1.6-2.2 | < 1.3 | Capital intensive, cyclical demand |
| **Energy - Oil & Gas** | > 1.8 | 1.2-1.8 | < 1.0 | Commodity cycles, capital intensive |
| **Energy - Renewables** | > 2.0 | 1.5-2.0 | < 1.2 | Project financing, development cycles |
| **Utilities** | > 1.5 | 1.2-1.5 | < 1.0 | Regulated, predictable cash flows |
| **Real Estate - REITs** | > 1.8 | 1.3-1.8 | < 1.1 | Property-focused, dividend requirements |
| **Materials** | > 1.8 | 1.3-1.8 | < 1.1 | Commodity cycles, inventory fluctuations |
| **Telecommunications** | > 1.5 | 1.2-1.5 | < 1.0 | Stable revenue, high capex needs |

#### Quick Ratio (Acid Test) Benchmarks

| Sector | Strong | Acceptable | Weak | Key Characteristics |
|--------|--------|------------|------|-------------------|
| **Technology - Software** | > 2.5 | 1.8-2.5 | < 1.3 | Minimal inventory, strong liquidity |
| **Technology - Hardware** | > 1.8 | 1.2-1.8 | < 0.9 | Inventory-heavy, lower quick ratio |
| **Healthcare - Pharmaceuticals** | > 2.5 | 2.0-2.5 | < 1.5 | Strong cash position, minimal inventory |

### Understanding Sector Financial Ratio Differences

#### Why Financial Ratios Vary by Sector

**1. Business Model Differences**
- **Asset-light businesses** (Software, Services): Higher ROA and ROE due to minimal asset requirements
- **Asset-heavy businesses** (Utilities, Manufacturing): Lower asset turnover but stable returns
- **Leveraged businesses** (Banks, REITs): Use debt as part of core business model

**2. Working Capital Requirements**
- **Manufacturing sectors**: Higher working capital for inventory and receivables
- **Service sectors**: Lower working capital, faster cash conversion
- **Seasonal businesses**: Variable working capital needs throughout the year

**3. Capital Structure Norms**
- **Stable cash flow businesses**: Can support higher debt levels safely
- **Cyclical businesses**: Need lower leverage to survive downturns
- **Growth businesses**: Often maintain conservative capital structures for flexibility

**4. Profitability Patterns**
- **High-margin businesses**: Software, pharmaceuticals with patent protection
- **Low-margin businesses**: Retail, commodities with competitive pressure
- **Regulated businesses**: Utilities with controlled but stable returns

#### Economic Cycle Impact on Financial Ratios

**Early Recovery**:
- **Improving liquidity**: Current ratios strengthen as demand recovers
- **Leverage normalization**: Debt ratios improve with earnings recovery
- **Efficiency gains**: Asset turnover improves with capacity utilization

**Mid-Cycle Expansion**:
- **Peak efficiency**: Best asset turnover and working capital management
- **Margin expansion**: Profitability ratios reach cycle highs
- **Leverage optimization**: Companies may increase debt for growth

**Late Cycle**:
- **Margin pressure**: Competition and costs squeeze profitability
- **Working capital strain**: Inventory buildup, slower receivables collection
- **Leverage concerns**: Debt ratios may deteriorate if earnings slow

**Recession**:
- **Liquidity focus**: Current ratios become critical for survival

- Focus on within-sector relative performance

**2. Ignoring Business Cycles**
- Don't compare peak cycle performance to trough cycle companies
- Understand seasonal patterns that affect ratios
- Consider economic environment impacts

**3. Static Analysis**
- Don't rely solely on single-period ratios
- Analyze trends and trajectory of financial performance
- Consider management's strategic direction impact

**4. Benchmark Rigidity**
- Industry disruption can change normal ratio ranges
- High-quality companies may justify premium ratios
- Consider company-specific circumstances and strategy

### Working Capital Analysis

#### Working Capital
$$\text{Working Capital} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{Working Capital} = \$28,000,000 - \$13,000,000 = \$15,000,000$$

#### Working Capital Ratio
$$\text{Working Capital Ratio} = \frac{\text{Working Capital}}{\text{Total Assets}} \times 100\%$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{Working Capital Ratio} = \frac{\$15,000,000}{\$65,000,000} = 23.1\%$$

### Leverage Ratios

**Leverage ratios** measure how much debt a company uses to finance its assets.

#### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
$$\text{Debt-to-Equity} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}}$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{Debt-to-Equity} = \frac{\$23,000,000}{\$28,000,000} = 0.82$$

#### Debt-to-Assets Ratio
$$\text{Debt-to-Assets} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}} \times 100\%$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{Debt-to-Assets} = \frac{\$23,000,000}{\$65,000,000} = 35.4\%$$

#### Interest Coverage Ratio
$$\text{Interest Coverage} = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Interest Expense}}$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{Interest Coverage} = \frac{\$12,000,000}{\$2,000,000} = 6.0$$

**Interpretation**: Company can pay interest expense 6 times over with operating income.

### Profitability Ratios

#### Return on Assets (ROA)
$$\text{ROA} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}} \times 100\%$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{ROA} = \frac{\$7,875,000}{\$65,000,000} = 12.1\%$$

#### Return on Equity (ROE)
$$\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}} \times 100\%$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{ROE} = \frac{\$7,875,000}{\$28,000,000} = 28.1\%$$

#### Gross Profit Margin
$$\text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100\%$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\$40,000,000}{\$100,000,000} = 40\%$$

### Efficiency Ratios

#### Asset Turnover
$$\text{Asset Turnover} = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{Asset Turnover} = \frac{\$100,000,000}{\$65,000,000} = 1.54$$

#### Inventory Turnover
$$\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Average Inventory}}$$

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
$$\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\$60,000,000}{\$8,000,000} = 7.5$$

#### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
$$\text{DSO} = \frac{\text{Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Daily Sales}}$$

Where Daily Sales = Annual Revenue รท 365

**ABC Manufacturing Example:**
- **Daily sales**: \$100,000,000 รท 365 = \$273,973
- **DSO**: \$12,000,000 รท \$273,973 = 44 days

## Advanced Financial Analysis for Security Selection

Understanding how to analyze financial statements helps investors identify financially strong companies and avoid potential problems.

### Earnings Quality Analysis

#### Earnings Stability
**Why it matters**: Consistent profitability indicates a stable business model and reliable management.

**Analysis approach**: Examine 10-year income statement history to identify:
- **Consistent profits**: Companies that generate profits year after year
- **Earnings volatility**: How much earnings fluctuate during economic cycles
- **Trend analysis**: Whether earnings are growing, declining, or stable

#### Earnings Growth Assessment
**Why it matters**: Growing earnings typically lead to higher stock prices over time.

**Calculation**:
$$\text{EPS Growth Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Current EPS}}{\text{EPS 10 Years Ago}}\right)^{\frac{1}{10}} - 1$$

**What to look for**:
- **Sustainable growth**: Moderate, consistent growth is often better than explosive growth
- **Quality of growth**: Growth from operations vs. financial engineering
- **Future prospects**: Whether growth can continue based on market conditions

### Dividend Analysis

#### Dividend Consistency
**Why it matters**: Regular dividend payments indicate financial stability and management confidence.

**Analysis approach**:
- **Payment history**: Look for companies with long dividend payment records
- **Dividend coverage**: Ensure earnings can support dividend payments
- **Payout ratio**: Percentage of earnings paid as dividends

#### Dividend Coverage Ratio
$$\text{Dividend Coverage} = \frac{\text{Earnings per Share}}{\text{Dividends per Share}}$$

**Interpretation**:
- **Above 2.0**: Strong coverage, dividends likely sustainable
- **1.0-2.0**: Moderate coverage, monitor closely
- **Below 1.0**: Unsustainable, dividend cuts likely

### Asset Quality Assessment

#### Current Asset Analysis
**Cash and equivalents**: 
- **Importance**: Provides financial flexibility and crisis protection
- **Quality**: Highest quality asset, immediately available

**Accounts receivable**:
- **Importance**: Indicates customer payment patterns
- **Quality**: Good if collection periods are reasonable and stable
- **Red flag**: Rapidly growing receivables may indicate collection problems

**Inventory**:
- **Importance**: Shows operational efficiency
- **Quality**: Lower quality due to obsolescence risk
- **Analysis**: Compare inventory turnover to industry peers

#### Fixed Asset Analysis
**Property, plant & equipment**:
- **Depreciation adequacy**: Are depreciation rates realistic for asset replacement?
- **Asset age**: Are assets modern and competitive?
- **Maintenance capex**: How much is needed to maintain operations?

**Intangible assets**:
- **Goodwill**: Premium paid for acquisitions - can become impaired
- **Patents/trademarks**: Valuable if they provide competitive advantages
- **Software**: Important for technology companies

### Liability Management Analysis

#### Current Liability Assessment
**Why it matters**: Shows how well a company manages short-term obligations.

**Key factors**:
- **Payment terms**: Reasonable payment periods with suppliers
- **Seasonal patterns**: Whether liabilities fluctuate with business cycles
- **Working capital management**: Efficient use of supplier financing

#### Long-term Debt Analysis
**Why it matters**: Excessive debt increases financial risk and reduces flexibility.

**Key considerations**:
- **Interest rates**: Fixed vs. variable rate exposure
- **Maturity schedule**: When debts come due and refinancing needs
- **Debt covenants**: Restrictive terms that could limit operations

### Book Value and Liquidation Analysis

#### Tangible Book Value
$$\text{Tangible Book Value} = \text{Total Equity} - \text{Intangible Assets}$$

**Why it matters**: Provides a conservative measure of company value excluding intangible assets that may have uncertain value.

#### Book Value per Share
$$\text{Book Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

**Uses**:
- **Valuation benchmark**: Compare stock price to book value
- **Downside protection**: Indicates potential liquidation value
- **Asset-heavy industries**: Particularly relevant for banks, REITs, utilities

#### Conservative Liquidation Analysis
**Purpose**: Estimate what shareholders might receive if company were liquidated.

**Conservative asset values**:
- **Cash**: 100% of stated value (highest quality)
- **Marketable securities**: 90-95% of market value
- **Accounts receivable**: 80-90% of stated value (collection losses)
- **Inventory**: 50-70% of stated value (liquidation discounts)
- **Fixed assets**: 10-50% depending on type and condition

### Net Current Asset Value Analysis

#### NCAV Calculation
$$\text{NCAV} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}$$

**Why it matters**: Shows the value of liquid assets after paying all debts.

**Investment implications**:
- **Positive NCAV**: Company has liquid assets exceeding all debts
- **High NCAV per share**: May indicate undervaluation
- **Negative NCAV**: Company depends on fixed assets and future earnings

#### NCAV per Share
$$\text{NCAV per Share} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

**Example using ABC Manufacturing:**
- **Current assets**: \$28,000,000
- **Total liabilities**: \$37,000,000
- **NCAV**: \$28,000,000 - \$37,000,000 = -\$9,000,000

**Analysis**: Negative NCAV indicates the company relies on fixed assets and future earnings rather than liquid assets for value.

## REIT-Specific Accounting Considerations

Real Estate Investment Trusts have unique accounting characteristics that require special analysis.

### REIT Financial Statements

#### REIT Balance Sheet Focus

**1. Investment Properties**
- **Cost basis**: Original purchase price plus improvements
- **Accumulated depreciation**: Total depreciation taken over time
- **Net book value**: Cost minus accumulated depreciation
- **Fair value**: Current market value (often disclosed separately)

**2. REIT-Specific Assets**
- **Land**: Not depreciated (land doesn't wear out)
- **Buildings**: Depreciated over 27.5-39 years
- **Tenant improvements**: Depreciated over lease term
- **Furniture and fixtures**: Depreciated over 5-7 years

#### REIT Income Statement Focus

**1. Rental Revenue**
- **Base rent**: Fixed rental payments from tenants
- **Percentage rent**: Additional rent based on tenant sales
- **Expense reimbursements**: Tenants paying for property expenses
- **Other income**: Parking, laundry, vending machines

**2. Property Operating Expenses**
- **Property taxes**: Real estate taxes on properties
- **Insurance**: Property and liability insurance
- **Utilities**: Electricity, water, gas for common areas
- **Maintenance and repairs**: Ongoing property upkeep
- **Property management**: Fees for managing properties

#### Funds From Operations (FFO)

**FFO** is the key REIT profitability metric because it adds back real estate depreciation.

$$\text{FFO} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Depreciation} + \text{Amortization} - \text{Gains on Sales}$$

**Why FFO Matters**: Real estate typically appreciates over time, but accounting rules require depreciation, making net income misleading for REITs.

#### Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)

$$\text{AFFO} = \text{FFO} - \text{Recurring Capital Expenditures}$$

**Purpose**: More conservative measure that accounts for ongoing capital needs.

### REIT Financial Ratios

#### FFO per Share
$$\text{FFO per Share} = \frac{\text{Funds From Operations}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

#### Price-to-FFO Ratio
$$\text{P/FFO} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{FFO per Share}}$$

**Typical Range**: 10-20 times FFO for most REITs.

#### Debt-to-Total Capitalization
$$\text{Debt-to-Total Cap} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Debt} + \text{Market Value of Equity}}$$

**REIT Target**: Most REITs target 30-50% debt-to-total capitalization.

#### Interest Coverage (REIT Version)
$$\text{Interest Coverage} = \frac{\text{EBITDA}}{\text{Interest Expense}}$$

Where EBITDA = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.

## Red Flags in Financial Statements

Understanding what to watch for can help you avoid problematic investments.

### Balance Sheet Red Flags

#### 1. Deteriorating Liquidity
- **Declining current ratio**: May indicate cash flow problems
- **Increasing accounts payable**: Company may be struggling to pay bills
- **Decreasing cash**: Could signal operational difficulties

#### 2. Excessive Debt
- **High debt-to-equity ratios**: Increases financial risk
- **Short-term debt increases**: May indicate refinancing problems
- **Off-balance-sheet obligations**: Hidden debt in footnotes

#### 3. Asset Quality Issues
- **Increasing accounts receivable**: May indicate collection problems
- **Growing inventory**: Could signal slowing sales
