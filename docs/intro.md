## Introduction

Investing is the process of putting your money to work so it can potentially grow and generate returns. Unlike saving, which focuses on safety and easy access, investing focuses on growth over longer periods of time—accepting some risk for the chance of higher returns.

You don’t need a finance degree to start. With a few core principles and consistent action, you can build real wealth over time.

:::tip
Start small and start now. Time in the market beats timing the market.

## Why learn investing?

- Beat inflation: Prices rise over time. Investing helps your money grow faster than inflation so your purchasing power doesn’t shrink.
- Reach goals: House deposit, education, retirement—long-term goals usually need growth beyond what a savings account provides.
- Let time work for you: Compounding returns can turn small, consistent contributions into large sums.
- Diversify your income: Investments can generate dividends, interest, or capital gains, supplementing your income.
- Build confidence: Understanding risk and return helps you make smarter, calmer decisions—especially during market swings.

Quick scenario:
- Saving \$200/month at 0.5% interest for 20 years ≈ \$49,000.
- Investing \$200/month at 7% average annual return for 20 years ≈ \$104,000.
- The difference, ~+\$55,000, largely comes from compounding returns.

## Difference between saving and investing

| Aspect           | Saving                                         | Investing                                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Goal             | Safety and liquidity                           | Growth over the long term                                  |
| Time horizon     | Short-term (0–3 years)                         | Long-term (5+ years)                                       |
| Risk             | Very low (bank accounts, money markets)        | Varies (stocks, bonds, ETFs, real estate, etc.)            |
| Expected returns | Low (often near inflation)                     | Higher on average, but not guaranteed                       |
| Access to funds  | Easy and immediate                             | May fluctuate in value; selling can take time               |
| Use cases        | Emergency fund, near-term purchases            | Retirement, education fund, building wealth                 |

Rules of thumb:
- Keep 3–6 months of essential expenses in an emergency fund (in savings).
- Invest money you won’t need for at least 3–5 years.
- Match the tool to the time: short-term money in savings; long-term money in investments.

:::caution
Investing involves risk, including the potential loss of principal. Diversify and align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

## The power of compounding

Compounding is “interest on interest.” When your gains are reinvested, they generate their own gains—creating an exponential growth effect over time.

- Basic idea: Future Value (FV) equals Principal (P) times one plus the annual return rate (r) raised to the power of time in years (t): $FV = P \times (1 + r)^{t}$  
- Regular contributions supercharge compounding: even small amounts add up when invested consistently.

Examples (illustrative, not guarantees):
- Lump sum: \$5,000 × $(1.07)^{30}$ ≈ \$38,000
- Monthly contributions: \$100/month at 7% for 30 years ≈ \$121,000 total value vs. \$36,000 contributed out of pocket.

Why time matters:
- Starting earlier gives compounding more years to work.
- Waiting 10 years can require you to contribute dramatically more each month to reach the same end goal.

Key takeaways:
- Reinvest dividends and interest.
- Be consistent with contributions (automate if possible).
- Focus on time in the market, not timing the market.

## Next steps

- Choose a simple, diversified investment approach (e.g., low-cost broad-market index funds).
- Automate contributions and review annually.
