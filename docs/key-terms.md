# Key Financial and Accounting Terms

This chapter provides clear, beginner-friendly definitions of all the financial and accounting terms used throughout this book. Use this as a reference guide when you encounter unfamiliar terms while reading or investing.

---

## A

### **Accounts Payable**
Money that a company owes to its suppliers for goods or services it has received but not yet paid for. This appears as a liability on the balance sheet. Think of it like your credit card balance - you've received something but haven't paid for it yet.

### **Accounts Receivable**
Money that customers owe to a company for goods or services the company has already delivered. This appears as an asset on the balance sheet because the company expects to collect this money, usually within 30-90 days.

### **Additional Paid-in Capital (APIC)**
This represents the amount of money investors have paid for a company's shares over and above the shares' par value. When a company issues stock, the actual price paid by investors is usually much higher than the nominal par value. For example, if a share has a par value of \$1 but investors paid \$20 for it, the `Additional Paid-in Capital` for that share would be \$19. Together with Common Stock (at par value), this account represents the total capital a company has received directly from its shareholders when it initially sold them stock.

### **Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)**
A more conservative measure of REIT profitability that subtracts necessary capital expenditures from FFO. The formula is:
$$\text{AFFO} = \text{FFO} - \text{Recurring Capital Expenditures}$$

### **Annual Return**
The percentage gain or loss on an investment over a one-year period. For example, if you invest \$1,000 and it grows to \$1,100 in one year, your annual return is 10%.

### **Anchoring**
A psychological bias where investors fixate on irrelevant reference points (like purchase price or recent highs) when making investment decisions, rather than focusing on current fundamentals and future prospects.

### **Asset Allocation**
The process of dividing your investment portfolio among different asset categories such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. A common allocation might be 60% stocks, 30% bonds, and 10% real estate.

### **Assets**
Everything of value that a company owns. This includes cash, inventory, equipment, buildings, and investments. Assets are divided into current assets (can be converted to cash within one year) and non-current assets (longer-term items like buildings and equipment).

---

## B

### **Balance Sheet**
A financial statement that shows a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It lists all assets (what the company owns), liabilities (what it owes), and shareholders' equity (what belongs to the owners). The equation is: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity.

### **Bear Market**
A period when stock prices are falling or expected to fall by 20% or more from recent highs. During bear markets, investor sentiment is generally pessimistic and many people sell their investments.

### **Behavioral Finance**
The study of how psychological factors and emotions affect financial decisions and market movements. It explains why investors often make irrational decisions that hurt their long-term returns.

### **Book Value**
The accounting value of a company calculated as total assets minus total liabilities. It represents what shareholders would theoretically receive if the company were liquidated (sold off) immediately.

### **Book Value per Share**
The book value of a company divided by the number of shares outstanding. The formula is:
$$\text{Book Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

### **Brand Power**
A competitive advantage where a company's brand name allows it to charge higher prices than competitors. Examples include Apple charging premium prices for iPhones or Nike commanding higher prices for athletic shoes than generic brands.

### **Bull Market**
A period when stock prices are rising or expected to rise. During bull markets, investor confidence is high and people are generally optimistic about buying investments.

### **Business Risk**
The fundamental risk that a company's business may fail or perform poorly due to factors like competition, management mistakes, industry changes, or economic conditions.

---

## C

### **Capital Gains**
The profit made when you sell an investment for more than you paid for it. If you buy a stock for \$50 and sell it for \$70, you have a \$20 capital gain.

### **Cash and Cash Equivalents**
The most liquid assets a company has, including money in bank accounts and short-term investments that can be quickly converted to cash (like Treasury bills or money market funds).

### **Cash Flow Statement**
A financial statement that tracks how cash moves in and out of a business over a specific period. It's divided into three sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.

### **Circle of Competence**
The areas of business and investing that you understand well enough to make informed decisions. Warren Buffett emphasizes staying within your circle of competence and only investing in businesses you can thoroughly understand.

### **Common Stock**
The most basic form of corporate ownership, representing shares of a company held by investors. It's listed on the balance sheet at its `par value`, which is a nominal and often symbolic value assigned to the shares, bearing little relation to their market price. Common stockholders generally have voting rights, receive dividends (when declared), and a residual claim on the company's assets and earnings after all liabilities and preferred stock obligations are met.

### **Competitive Advantage**
Features that allow a company to outperform its competitors consistently. This might include lower costs, better products, stronger brand recognition, or exclusive access to resources or markets.

### **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**
The rate at which an investment would need to grow each year to reach its ending value from its beginning value over a specified time period. The formula is:
$$\text{CAGR} = \left(\frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\text{Number of Years}}} - 1$$

### **Compounding**
The process where your investment earnings generate their own earnings over time. For example, if you earn 10% on \$1,000 (making \$100), next year you earn 10% on \$1,100, creating a snowball effect.

### **Concentration Risk**
The risk that comes from having too much of your portfolio invested in a single stock, sector, or type of investment. If that investment performs poorly, it can significantly damage your overall portfolio.

### **Confirmation Bias**
The tendency to seek out information that confirms what you already believe while ignoring contradictory evidence. This can lead investors to hold losing investments too long or miss warning signs.

### **Corporate Bonds**
Debt securities issued by companies to raise money. When you buy a corporate bond, you're lending money to the company in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of your principal when the bond matures.

### **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
The direct costs of producing the goods or services that a company sells. For a manufacturing company, this includes raw materials, direct labor, and factory overhead.

### **Coupon Payments**
The regular interest payments made to bondholders, typically twice per year. If you own a \$1,000 bond with a 5% coupon rate, you'll receive \$50 per year in coupon payments.

### **Coupon Rate**
The annual interest rate stated on a bond, expressed as a percentage of the bond's face value. This rate never changes during the life of the bond.

### **Credit Ratings**
Assessments of the likelihood that a bond issuer will repay their debt. Ratings range from AAA (highest quality, lowest risk) to D (in default). Investment grade bonds are rated BBB or higher.

### **Credit Risk**
The risk that a bond issuer might default on their payments or go bankrupt. Higher-risk bonds typically pay higher interest rates to compensate investors for taking on this risk.

### **Current Assets**
Assets that can be converted to cash within one year, including cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and short-term investments.

### **Current Liabilities**
Debts and obligations that must be paid within one year, including accounts payable, short-term debt, and accrued expenses.

### **Current Ratio**
A measure of a company's ability to pay its short-term debts. The formula is:
$$\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$
A ratio above 1.0 means the company can cover its current liabilities.

### **Current Yield**
The annual return on a bond based on its current market price rather than its face value. The formula is:
$$\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Current Market Price}}$$

---

## D

### **Debt-to-Assets Ratio**
The percentage of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:
$$\text{Debt-to-Assets} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}} \times 100\%$$

### **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
A measure of how much debt a company has relative to shareholders' equity. The formula is:
$$\text{Debt-to-Equity} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}}$$
Higher ratios indicate more financial leverage and risk.

### **Depreciation**
The gradual reduction in value of physical assets (like equipment or buildings) over time as they wear out or become obsolete. Companies spread the cost of assets over their useful life through depreciation.

### **Discount Rate**
The interest rate used to calculate the present value of future cash flows in valuation models. It reflects the risk and time value of money.

### **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model**
A valuation method that estimates the intrinsic value of an investment based on the present value of its expected future cash flows.

### **Diversification**
The practice of spreading investments across different types of assets, industries, and geographic regions to reduce risk. The idea is that if one investment performs poorly, others may perform well.

### **Dividend Discount Model (DDM)**
A valuation method that calculates the intrinsic value of a stock based on the present value of its expected future dividend payments.

### **Dividend Withholding Tax**
A tax on dividends paid to foreign investors. For example, non-US residents typically pay 15-30% withholding tax on US dividend payments.

### **Dividend Yield**
The annual dividend payment expressed as a percentage of the stock price. The formula is:
$$\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividend per Share}}{\text{Current Stock Price}} \times 100\%$$

### **Dividends**
Cash payments that some companies make to shareholders from their profits. Not all companies pay dividends; some prefer to reinvest profits for growth.

### **Dollar-Cost Averaging**
An investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals regardless of market conditions. This helps reduce the impact of market volatility on your investments.

### **Duration**
A measure of how sensitive a bond's price is to changes in interest rates. Longer-duration bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes than shorter-duration bonds.

### **Economic Moat**
Warren Buffett's term for sustainable competitive advantages that protect a company's profits from competition, like a moat protects a medieval castle from invaders.

### **Future Value**
The value of a current investment at a specific date in the future based on an assumed growth rate. The formula is:
$$\text{Future Value} = \text{Present Value} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Periods}}$$
