# Chapter 9: Valuation

Valuation is the process of determining the intrinsic value of a company based on its financial statements, business fundamentals, and future prospects. Understanding valuation helps investors identify whether a stock is overpriced, fairly valued, or undervalued in the market. This chapter builds on the accounting knowledge from Chapter 8 to teach you how to calculate what a company is actually worth.

## What is Intrinsic Value?

### Definition of Intrinsic Value

**Intrinsic value** is the true economic value of a company based on its underlying business fundamentals, regardless of its current market price.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Objective value**: Based on financial facts, not market sentiment
- **Long-term perspective**: Focuses on sustainable earning power
- **Margin of safety**: Buying below intrinsic value provides protection
- **Independent of market price**: What the business is worth, not what others will pay

#### Market Price vs. Intrinsic Value:
- **Market price**: What investors are currently willing to pay
- **Intrinsic value**: What the business is actually worth
- **Investment opportunity**: When market price is below intrinsic value

### The Foundation of Value Investing

**Value investing** is based on the principle that every security has an intrinsic value that can be calculated through careful analysis.

#### Benjamin Graham's Approach:
1. **Quantitative analysis**: Use financial statements to calculate value
2. **Conservative estimates**: Be cautious with projections and assumptions
3. **Margin of safety**: Only buy when price is significantly below intrinsic value
4. **Long-term perspective**: Focus on business fundamentals, not short-term price movements

#### Why Valuation Matters:
- **Risk reduction**: Buying below intrinsic value limits downside risk
- **Return enhancement**: Undervalued securities offer better return potential
- **Disciplined investing**: Prevents emotional decision-making
- **Objective framework**: Provides systematic approach to investment decisions

## Common Valuation Ratios

Valuation ratios compare a company's market price to various financial metrics, helping investors assess whether a stock is expensive or cheap relative to its fundamentals.

### Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)

The **Price-to-Earnings ratio** compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share.

#### P/E Ratio Formula:
$$\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Earnings per Share (EPS)}}$$

#### Alternative Calculation:
$$\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Capitalization}}{\text{Net Income}}$$

#### Example Calculation:
**ABC Manufacturing:**
- **Stock price**: \$50
- **EPS**: \$2.50
- **P/E ratio**: \$50 รท \$2.50 = 20

**Interpretation**: Investors are paying \$20 for every \$1 of annual earnings.

#### What P/E Ratio Means:

**1. Valuation Indicator**
- **Low P/E**: May indicate undervaluation or poor growth prospects
- **High P/E**: May indicate overvaluation or strong growth expectations
- **Industry comparison**: Compare to similar companies and historical averages

**2. Growth Expectations**
- **High P/E**: Market expects strong earnings growth
- **Low P/E**: Market expects slow or declining earnings
- **P/E expansion**: Ratio increases as growth expectations improve

#### When to Use P/E Ratio:

**Best for:**
- **Profitable companies**: Requires positive earnings
- **Mature businesses**: Stable earnings make ratio more meaningful
- **Cyclical analysis**: Compare P/E at similar business cycle points
- **Peer comparison**: Evaluate relative valuation within industry

**Limitations:**
- **Negative earnings**: Ratio becomes meaningless
- **Volatile earnings**: One-time items can distort the ratio
- **Different accounting**: Earnings quality varies between companies
- **Growth stage**: High-growth companies may appear expensive

#### P/E Ratio Variations:

**1. Trailing P/E**
$$\text{Trailing P/E} = \frac{\text{Current Stock Price}}{\text{EPS (Last 12 Months)}}$$

**2. Forward P/E**
$$\text{Forward P/E} = \frac{\text{Current Stock Price}}{\text{Estimated EPS (Next 12 Months)}}$$

**3. Shiller P/E (CAPE)**
$$\text{Shiller P/E} = \frac{\text{Current Stock Price}}{\text{Average EPS (Last 10 Years, Inflation-Adjusted)}}$$

### Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B)

The **Price-to-Book ratio** compares a company's market value to its book value (shareholders' equity).

#### P/B Ratio Formula:
$$\text{P/B Ratio} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Book Value per Share}}$$

#### Book Value per Share:
$$\text{Book Value per Share} = \frac{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

#### Example Calculation:
**ABC Manufacturing:**
- **Stock price**: \$50
- **Shareholders' equity**: \$28,000,000
- **Shares outstanding**: 1,000,000
- **Book value per share**: \$28,000,000 รท 1,000,000 = \$28
- **P/B ratio**: \$50 รท \$28 = 1.79

**Interpretation**: Investors are paying \$1.79 for every \$1 of book value.

#### What P/B Ratio Means:

**1. Asset Valuation and Earnings Relationship**
- **P/B < 1**: Trading below book value (potential bargain if assets generate earnings)
- **P/B > 1**: Trading above book value (justified if assets generate high returns)
- **Liquidation value**: Book value approximates what shareholders would receive in liquidation

**2. Return on Equity Relationship**
- **High ROE companies**: Often trade at higher P/B ratios because assets generate strong returns
- **Low ROE companies**: Often trade at lower P/B ratios because assets generate weak returns
- **Efficiency indicator**: How well management uses shareholder capital to generate profits

**3. When Book Value Matters Most for Earnings**

**Asset-Dependent Businesses**: P/B ratio is crucial when physical assets are essential for generating revenue and profits.

**Banks and Financial Institutions**:
- **Why book value matters**: Loans and deposits are the primary assets that generate interest income
- **Asset quality**: Book value reflects the lending capacity and deposit base
- **Earnings connection**: More assets (higher book value) typically means more lending capacity and higher interest income
- **Example**: A bank with \$10 billion in assets can make more loans and earn more interest than one with \$1 billion

**REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)**:
- **Why book value matters**: Properties are the income-generating assets
- **Asset quality**: Book value represents the property portfolio that generates rental income
- **Earnings connection**: More valuable properties (higher book value) typically generate higher rental income
- **Example**: A REIT owning \$500 million in prime office buildings will generate more rent than one owning \$100 million in properties

**Utilities**:
- **Why book value matters**: Power plants, transmission lines, and infrastructure generate revenue
- **Asset quality**: Book value represents the infrastructure that provides essential services
- **Earnings connection**: More infrastructure assets enable serving more customers and generating more revenue
- **Example**: A utility with extensive power generation and distribution assets can serve more customers

**Manufacturing Companies**:
- **Why book value matters**: Factories, equipment, and machinery are needed to produce goods
- **Asset quality**: Book value represents productive capacity
- **Earnings connection**: More efficient, modern equipment can produce more goods at lower costs
- **Example**: A manufacturer with \$100 million in modern equipment can produce more efficiently than one with \$20 million in old equipment

**When Book Value is Less Important**:

**Technology and Software Companies**:
- **Limited physical assets**: Most value comes from intellectual property and human capital
- **Intangible value**: Patents, software, and brand value not fully reflected in book value
- **Example**: A software company might have minimal physical assets but generate huge profits from intellectual property

**Service Businesses**:
- **Human capital focus**: Value comes from employee skills and relationships, not physical assets
- **Low asset requirements**: Don't need significant physical assets to generate revenue
- **Example**: A consulting firm might operate with minimal physical assets but generate high profits from expertise

#### When to Use P/B Ratio:

**Best for:**
- **Asset-heavy businesses**: Banks, REITs, utilities, manufacturing where physical assets drive earnings
- **Cyclical companies**: When earnings are temporarily depressed but assets retain value
- **Distressed situations**: When company is losing money but assets have liquidation value
- **Conservative valuation**: Provides downside protection estimate based on tangible assets

**Limitations:**
- **Intangible assets**: Book value may understate true asset value for IP-heavy companies
- **Inflation effects**: Historical cost may not reflect current replacement values
- **Asset quality**: Not all assets are worth their book value (obsolete equipment, bad loans)
- **Service businesses**: Limited physical assets make ratio less relevant for earnings analysis

#### Tangible Book Value:

For more conservative analysis, use tangible book value:

$$\text{Tangible Book Value} = \text{Shareholders' Equity} - \text{Intangible Assets}$$

$$\text{Price-to-Tangible Book} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Tangible Book Value per Share}}$$

### Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S)

The **Price-to-Sales ratio** compares a company's market value to its annual revenue.

#### P/S Ratio Formula:
$$\text{P/S Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Capitalization}}{\text{Annual Revenue}}$$

#### Alternative Calculation:
$$\text{P/S Ratio} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Revenue per Share}}$$

#### Example Calculation:
**ABC Manufacturing:**
- **Market cap**: \$50,000,000 (1M shares ร \$50)
- **Annual revenue**: \$100,000,000
- **P/S ratio**: \$50,000,000 รท \$100,000,000 = 0.5

**Interpretation**: Investors are paying \$0.50 for every \$1 of annual sales.

#### What P/S Ratio Means:

**1. Revenue Valuation**
- **Low P/S**: May indicate undervaluation or low profitability
- **High P/S**: May indicate overvaluation or high profit margins
- **Margin analysis**: Consider profit margins when interpreting P/S

**2. Growth Assessment**
- **High-growth companies**: Often trade at higher P/S ratios
- **Mature companies**: Typically trade at lower P/S ratios
- **Market expectations**: Reflects anticipated revenue growth

#### When to Use P/S Ratio:

**Best for:**
- **Unprofitable companies**: When P/E ratio is not meaningful
- **Early-stage growth**: Companies investing heavily for future growth
- **Cyclical analysis**: When earnings are temporarily depressed
- **Revenue quality**: Companies with predictable, recurring revenue

**Limitations:**
- **Profitability ignored**: Revenue doesn't equal profit
- **Margin differences**: Companies with different margins aren't comparable
- **Revenue quality**: Not all revenue is created equal
- **Accounting differences**: Revenue recognition can vary

#### P/S Ratio by Industry:

Different industries have typical P/S ratio ranges:
- **Software/Technology**: 5-15 (high margins, recurring revenue)
- **Retail**: 0.5-2.0 (low margins, high turnover)
- **Manufacturing**: 1-3 (moderate margins, cyclical)
- **Utilities**: 1-2 (stable margins, regulated)

### Price-to-Free Cash Flow Ratio (P/FCF)

The **Price-to-Free Cash Flow ratio** compares a company's market value to its free cash flow, which represents the actual cash available to shareholders.

#### P/FCF Ratio Formula:
$$\text{P/FCF Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Capitalization}}{\text{Free Cash Flow}}$$

#### Free Cash Flow Calculation:
$$\text{Free Cash Flow} = \text{Operating Cash Flow} - \text{Capital Expenditures}$$

#### Example Calculation:
**ABC Manufacturing:**
- **Market cap**: \$50,000,000
- **Operating cash flow**: \$12,000,000
- **Capital expenditures**: \$3,000,000
- **Free cash flow**: \$12,000,000 - \$3,000,000 = \$9,000,000
- **P/FCF ratio**: \$50,000,000 รท \$9,000,000 = 5.6

**Interpretation**: Investors are paying \$5.60 for every \$1 of free cash flow generated.

#### What P/FCF Ratio Means:

**1. Cash Generation Quality**
- **Low P/FCF**: Company generates substantial cash relative to valuation
- **High P/FCF**: Either overvalued or requires heavy capital investment
- **Cash availability**: Free cash flow can be used for dividends, buybacks, or growth

**2. Capital Intensity Analysis**
- **Asset-light businesses**: Lower capital needs, higher free cash flow margins
- **Capital-intensive businesses**: Heavy reinvestment requirements reduce free cash flow
- **Maintenance vs. growth capex**: Understanding the nature of capital expenditures

#### When to Use P/FCF Ratio:

**Best for:**
- **Capital-intensive businesses**: Manufacturing, utilities, telecommunications
- **Cash flow analysis**: When earnings and cash flow differ significantly
- **Dividend sustainability**: Assessing ability to maintain dividend payments
- **Acquisition analysis**: Cash flow available for debt service

**Limitations:**
- **Cyclical variations**: Capital expenditures can vary significantly year-to-year
- **Growth phase companies**: May have low or negative free cash flow during expansion
- **Maintenance capex**: Difficult to distinguish between maintenance and growth spending
- **Timing differences**: Capital expenditures may not align with cash flow benefits

#### Understanding Capital Expenditure Patterns:

**Maintenance CapEx**: Required to maintain current operations
- **Replacement equipment**: Keeping existing capacity operational
- **Regulatory compliance**: Meeting safety and environmental standards
- **Technology updates**: Staying competitive with current offerings

**Growth CapEx**: Investments to expand the business
- **New facilities**: Adding production or service capacity
- **Market expansion**: Entering new geographic markets
- **Product development**: Creating new revenue streams

**Why This Matters for P/FCF Analysis**:
- **Sustainable free cash flow**: Focus on cash flow after necessary maintenance capex
- **Growth investment evaluation**: Assess whether growth capex generates adequate returns
- **Cyclical considerations**: Normalize for unusual capital expenditure years

### Price/Earnings-to-Growth Ratio (PEG)

The **PEG ratio** adjusts the P/E ratio for the company's expected earnings growth rate, helping identify whether a stock's valuation is justified by its growth prospects.

#### PEG Ratio Formula:
$$\text{PEG Ratio} = \frac{\text{P/E Ratio}}{\text{Earnings Growth Rate}}$$

#### Example Calculation:
**Growth Tech Company:**
- **P/E ratio**: 30
- **Expected earnings growth rate**: 25% annually
- **PEG ratio**: 30 รท 25 = 1.2

**Interpretation**: The company's P/E ratio is 1.2 times its growth rate.

#### What PEG Ratio Means:

**1. Growth-Adjusted Valuation**
- **PEG < 1.0**: Stock may be undervalued relative to its growth rate
- **PEG = 1.0**: Stock is fairly valued relative to growth (theoretical fair value)
- **PEG > 1.0**: Stock may be overvalued relative to its growth rate

**2. Comparing Growth Stocks**
- **High-growth companies**: Often have high P/E ratios, but PEG shows if it's justified
- **Growth comparison**: Compare companies with different growth rates on equal footing
- **Value vs. growth**: Helps bridge the gap between value and growth investing

#### When to Use PEG Ratio:

**Best for:**
- **Growth companies**: Companies with consistent, predictable earnings growth
- **Comparative analysis**: Comparing companies with different growth rates
- **Technology stocks**: High P/E ratios that may be justified by growth
- **Growth screening**: Finding reasonably priced growth stocks

**Limitations:**
- **Growth assumptions**: Highly dependent on accurate growth projections
- **Short-term focus**: Typically uses 1-year growth estimates
- **Cyclical companies**: Growth rates can be misleading during cycles
- **Quality ignored**: Doesn't account for business quality or competitive advantages

#### PEG Ratio Interpretation Guide:

**PEG < 0.5**: Potentially very undervalued (rare)
**PEG 0.5-1.0**: Potentially undervalued relative to growth
**PEG 1.0-1.5**: Fairly valued to slightly overvalued
**PEG 1.5-2.0**: Overvalued relative to growth
**PEG > 2.0**: Significantly overvalued (growth doesn't justify P/E)

### Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio (EV/EBITDA)

The **EV/EBITDA ratio** compares a company's total enterprise value to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. This ratio is useful for comparing companies with different capital structures.

#### Understanding Enterprise Value

**Enterprise Value (EV)** represents the total cost to acquire a company, including both equity and debt, minus cash.

**Simple Store Example:**
Imagine you want to buy a corner store:
- **Store asking price**: \$100,000 (market capitalization)
- **Store has debt**: \$30,000 (you'll need to pay this off)
- **Store has cash**: \$10,000 (you get to keep this)
- **Total cost to you**: \$100,000 + \$30,000 - \$10,000 = \$120,000

This \$120,000 is the "enterprise value" - what you actually pay to own the entire business.

#### Enterprise Value Formula:
$$\text{Enterprise Value} = \text{Market Capitalization} + \text{Total Debt} - \text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}$$

#### EV/EBITDA Formula:
$$\text{EV/EBITDA} = \frac{\text{Enterprise Value}}{\text{EBITDA}}$$

#### Example Calculation:
**ABC Manufacturing:**
- **Market cap**: \$50,000,000
- **Total debt**: \$20,000,000
- **Cash**: \$5,000,000
- **Enterprise value**: \$50M + \$20M - \$5M = \$65,000,000
- **EBITDA**: \$10,000,000
- **EV/EBITDA**: \$65,000,000 รท \$10,000,000 = 6.5

**Interpretation**: You're paying 6.5 times EBITDA to acquire the entire business.

#### What EV/EBITDA Means:

**1. Capital Structure Neutral**
- **Debt differences**: Accounts for different debt levels between companies
- **Cash positions**: Adjusts for cash holdings
- **True acquisition cost**: Shows what an acquirer would actually pay

**2. Operating Performance Focus**
- **EBITDA**: Excludes financing decisions (interest) and accounting policies (depreciation)
- **Core operations**: Focuses on underlying business performance
- **Comparability**: Better for comparing companies in same industry

#### When to Use EV/EBITDA:

**Best for:**
- **Capital-intensive industries**: Manufacturing, utilities, telecommunications
- **Acquisition analysis**: M&A valuations and comparable transactions
- **Cross-company comparison**: Companies with different capital structures
- **Cyclical businesses**: When depreciation distorts earnings

**Limitations:**
- **Capital expenditures ignored**: EBITDA doesn't account for necessary capex
- **Working capital changes**: Doesn't reflect cash flow from working capital
- **Asset-light businesses**: Less relevant for companies with minimal fixed assets
- **Growth companies**: May not reflect true cash generation

#### EV/EBITDA by Industry:

Different industries have typical EV/EBITDA ranges:
- **Technology**: 10-20ร (high growth, asset-light)
- **Utilities**: 8-12ร (stable, capital-intensive)
- **Manufacturing**: 6-10ร (cyclical, moderate growth)
- **Retail**: 5-8ร (low margins, working capital intensive)

#### Why Enterprise Value Matters:

**Real-World Acquisition Perspective:**
When a company acquires another business, they:
1. **Pay the market price** for shares (market capitalization)
2. **Assume the debt** (must pay off or service existing debt)
3. **Receive the cash** (can use existing cash for operations or debt paydown)

**Example: Acquiring a Restaurant Chain**
- **Stock price**: \$40 per share
- **Shares outstanding**: 1 million
- **Market cap**: \$40 million
- **Restaurant chain debt**: \$15 million (equipment loans, property mortgages)
- **Cash on hand**: \$3 million
- **Enterprise value**: \$40M + \$15M - \$3M = \$52 million

An acquirer would effectively pay \$52 million to own the restaurant business, not just the \$40 million stock price.

## Intrinsic Value Calculation Methods

There are several methods to calculate intrinsic value, each with different assumptions and applications.

### Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

The **Dividend Discount Model** values a stock based on the present value of its expected future dividends.

#### Basic DDM Formula:
$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \frac{D_1}{r - g}$$

Where:
- **Dโ**: Expected dividend next year
- **r**: Required rate of return
- **g**: Expected dividend growth rate

#### Example Calculation:
**XYZ Dividend Stock:**
- **Current dividend**: \$2.00 per share
- **Expected growth rate**: 5% annually
- **Required return**: 10%
- **Next year's dividend (Dโ)**: \$2.00 ร 1.05 = \$2.10

$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \frac{\$2.10}{0.10 - 0.05} = \frac{\$2.10}{0.05} = \$42$$

#### Multi-Stage DDM:

For companies with changing growth rates:

$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{D_t}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{D_{n+1}}{(r-g)(1+r)^n}$$

#### When to Use DDM:

**Best for:**
- **Dividend-paying stocks**: Requires consistent dividend payments
- **Mature companies**: Stable, predictable dividend policies
- **Utilities and REITs**: High dividend yields and stable payouts
- **Conservative investors**: Focus on income rather than growth

**Limitations:**
- **Non-dividend stocks**: Cannot value companies that don't pay dividends
- **Growth assumptions**: Sensitive to growth rate estimates
- **Required return**: Difficult to determine appropriate discount rate
- **Perpetual growth**: Assumes constant growth forever

### Discounted Cash Flow Model (DCF)

The **DCF model** values a company based on the present value of its expected future cash flows.

#### DCF Formula:
$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{FCF_t}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{TV}{(1+r)^n}$$

Where:
- **FCF**: Free cash flow
- **r**: Discount rate (WACC)
- **TV**: Terminal value
- **n**: Forecast period

#### Free Cash Flow Calculation:
$$\text{Free Cash Flow} = \text{Operating Cash Flow} - \text{Capital Expenditures}$$

#### Terminal Value Calculation:
$$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{FCF_{final} \times (1+g)}{r-g}$$

#### Example DCF Calculation:

**ABC Manufacturing 5-Year DCF:**

| Year | FCF Projection | Discount Factor (10%) | Present Value |
|------|----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| 1 | \$10,000,000 | 0.909 | \$9,090,000 |
| 2 | \$11,000,000 | 0.826 | \$9,086,000 |
| 3 | \$12,100,000 | 0.751 | \$9,087,000 |
| 4 | \$13,310,000 | 0.683 | \$9,091,000 |
| 5 | \$14,641,000 | 0.621 | \$9,092,000 |

**Terminal Value** (3% perpetual growth):
$$TV = \frac{\$14,641,000 \times 1.03}{0.10 - 0.03} = \frac{\$15,080,230}{0.07} = \$215,431,857$$

**Present Value of Terminal Value**:
$$PV_{TV} = \frac{\$215,431,857}{(1.10)^5} = \$133,789,000$$

**Total Enterprise Value**: \$45,446,000 + \$133,789,000 = \$179,235,000

#### When to Use DCF:

**Best for:**
- **Cash-generating businesses**: Requires predictable cash flows
- **Mature companies**: Stable operations with forecastable performance
- **Capital-intensive businesses**: Where cash flow differs significantly from earnings
- **Long-term investors**: Focus on fundamental business value

**Limitations:**
- **Forecast accuracy**: Highly sensitive to cash flow projections
- **Terminal value**: Large portion of value often in terminal period
- **Discount rate**: Difficult to determine appropriate rate
- **Growth assumptions**: Small changes in assumptions create large value differences

### Earnings-Based Valuation Models

#### Price-Earnings Valuation:
$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \text{EPS} \times \text{Justified P/E Ratio}$$

#### Justified P/E Calculation:
$$\text{Justified P/E} = \frac{\text{Payout Ratio} \times (1 + g)}{r - g}$$

#### Example:
**DEF Growth Company:**
- **Current EPS**: \$3.00
- **Payout ratio**: 40%
- **Growth rate**: 8%
- **Required return**: 12%

$$\text{Justified P/E} = \frac{0.40 \times 1.08}{0.12 - 0.08} = \frac{0.432}{0.04} = 10.8$$

$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \$3.00 \times 10.8 = \$32.40$$

### Benjamin Graham's Valuation Formulas

Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, developed specific formulas for calculating intrinsic value based on conservative assumptions.

#### Graham's Growth Stock Formula

For companies with expected growth, Graham developed this formula:

$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \text{EPS} \times (8.5 + 2g)$$

Where:
- **EPS**: Current earnings per share
- **8.5**: Base P/E ratio for a no-growth company
- **g**: Expected annual growth rate (as a percentage)

#### Example:
**Growth Company Analysis:**
- **Current EPS**: \$3.00
- **Expected growth rate**: 12% annually
- **Intrinsic value**: \$3.00 ร (8.5 + 2 ร 12) = \$3.00 ร 32.5 = \$97.50

#### Graham's Revised Formula

Graham later revised his formula to account for interest rates:

$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \frac{\text{EPS} \times (8.5 + 2g) \times 4.4}{Y}$$

Where:
- **4.4**: Corporate bond yield in 1962 when formula was created
- **Y**: Current AAA corporate bond yield

#### Example with Interest Rate Adjustment:
- **Current EPS**: \$3.00
- **Expected growth**: 12%
- **Current AAA bond yield**: 5.5%
- **Intrinsic value**: (\$3.00 ร 32.5 ร 4.4) รท 5.5 = \$78.00

#### Graham's Net-Net Working Capital Formula

For deep value situations, Graham focused on net current assets:

$$\text{NCAV per Share} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$

**Graham's Rule**: Buy stocks trading at less than 67% of NCAV per share.

#### Example NCAV Analysis:
**Value Stock Opportunity:**
- **Current assets**: \$50,000,000
- **Total liabilities**: \$30,000,000
- **NCAV**: \$20,000,000
- **Shares outstanding**: 2,000,000
- **NCAV per share**: \$10.00
- **Graham's buy price**: 67% ร \$10.00 = \$6.70

### Asset-Based Valuation

#### Net Current Asset Value (NCAV):
$$\text{NCAV} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}$$

#### Liquidation Value Approach:
$$\text{Liquidation Value} = \text{Conservative Asset Values} - \text{Total Liabilities}$$

**Conservative Asset Valuations:**
- **Cash**: 100% of stated value
- **Marketable securities**: 90% of market value
- **Accounts receivable**: 85% of stated value
- **Inventory**: 60% of stated value
- **Fixed assets**: 20% of book value

#### Example Liquidation Analysis:
**GHI Distressed Company:**

| Asset | Book Value | Conservative % | Liquidation Value |
|-------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Cash | \$5,000,000 | 100% | \$5,000,000 |
| Receivables | \$8,000,000 | 85% | \$6,800,000 |
| Inventory | \$12,000,000 | 60% | \$7,200,000 |
| Fixed Assets | \$20,000,000 | 20% | \$4,000,000 |
| **Total Assets** | **\$45,000,000** | | **\$23,000,000** |
| **Total Liabilities** | **\$30,000,000** | | **\$30,000,000** |
| **Liquidation Value** | | | **-\$7,000,000** |

**Analysis**: Company would have negative value in liquidation, indicating financial distress.

### Book Value Multiples

#### Price-to-Book Valuation:
$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \text{Book Value per Share} \times \text{Justified P/B Ratio}$$

#### Justified P/B Relationship:
$$\text{Justified P/B} = \frac{ROE - g}{r - g}$$

#### Example:
**JKL Bank:**
- **Book value per share**: \$25
- **ROE**: 15%
- **Growth rate**: 5%
- **Required return**: 12%

$$\text{Justified P/B} = \frac{0.15 - 0.05}{0.12 - 0.05} = \frac{0.10}{0.07} = 1.43$$

$$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \$25 \times 1.43 = \$35.75$$

---

## Advanced Valuation Techniques

### Sum-of-the-Parts Valuation

For companies with multiple business segments, value each part separately:

$$\text{Total Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Value of Segment}_i$$

#### Example:
**MNO Conglomerate:**
- **Retail division**: \$500M (valued at 1.5ร sales)
- **Manufacturing division**: \$300M (valued at 12ร earnings)
- **Real estate**: \$200M (valued at 1.2ร book value)
- **Total value**: \$1,000M

### Relative Valuation Analysis

Compare valuation multiples to similar companies:

#### Peer Comparison Method:
1. **Identify comparable companies**: Similar size, industry, growth
2. **Calculate average multiples**: P/E, P/B, P/S, EV/EBITDA
3. **Apply to target company**: Use peer multiples for valuation

#### Example Peer Analysis:
**Technology Sector P/E Ratios:**
- **Company A**: 25ร
- **Company B**: 30ร
- **Company C**: 20ร
- **Average P/E**: 25ร
- **Target company EPS**: \$2.00
- **Estimated value**: \$2.00 ร 25 = \$50

### Economic Value Added (EVA)

EVA measures value creation above the cost of capital:

$$\text{EVA} = \text{NOPAT} - (\text{Invested Capital} \times \text{WACC})$$

Where:
- **NOPAT**: Net Operating Profit After Tax
- **WACC**: Weighted Average Cost of Capital

#### EVA-Based Valuation:
$$\text{Market Value} = \text{Invested Capital} + \text{PV of Future EVA}$$

## Valuation Assumptions and Limitations

### Key Assumptions in Valuation Models

#### Growth Rate Assumptions:
- **Historical analysis**: Past growth patterns
- **Industry trends**: Sector growth expectations
- **Economic factors**: GDP growth, inflation
- **Company-specific**: Market share, competitive position

#### Discount Rate Assumptions:
- **Risk-free rate**: Government bond yields
- **Market risk premium**: Expected market return above risk-free rate
- **Beta**: Stock's sensitivity to market movements
- **Company-specific risk**: Additional risk factors

#### Terminal Value Assumptions:
- **Perpetual growth**: Long-term sustainable growth rate
- **Multiple approach**: Exit multiple based on comparables
- **Economic assumptions**: Long-term inflation, GDP growth

### Common Valuation Errors

#### 1. Overly Optimistic Projections:
- **Problem**: Assuming unrealistic growth rates
- **Solution**: Use conservative, well-supported assumptions
- **Check**: Compare to historical performance and industry norms

#### 2. Inappropriate Discount Rates:
- **Problem**: Using wrong risk adjustment
- **Solution**: Carefully assess company and market risk
- **Check**: Compare to similar companies and historical rates

#### 3. Terminal Value Overreliance:
- **Problem**: Too much value in terminal period
- **Solution**: Extend forecast period, use conservative terminal assumptions
- **Check**: Ensure terminal value is reasonable percentage of total

#### 4. Ignoring Cyclical Factors:
- **Problem**: Using peak or trough performance as normal
- **Solution**: Normalize earnings and cash flows
- **Check**: Analyze full business cycle performance

### Sensitivity Analysis

Test how changes in key assumptions affect valuation:

#### Example Sensitivity Table:
**DCF Valuation Sensitivity (Growth Rate vs. Discount Rate)**

| Growth Rate | 8% Discount | 10% Discount | 12% Discount |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 2% | \$65 | \$52 | \$43 |
| 3% | \$75 | \$58 | \$47 |
| 4% | \$88 | \$67 | \$52 |
| 5% | \$108 | \$78 | \$59 |

**Analysis**: Small changes in assumptions create large valuation differences, emphasizing the need for conservative estimates.

## Margin of Safety

### The Margin of Safety Concept

**Margin of safety** is the difference between intrinsic value and market price, providing protection against errors in valuation.

#### Margin of Safety Formula:
$$\text{Margin of Safety} = \frac{\text{Intrinsic Value} - \text{Market Price}}{\text{Intrinsic Value}} \times 100\%$$

#### Example:
- **Intrinsic value**: \$60
- **Market price**: \$45
- **Margin of safety**: (\$60 - \$45) รท \$60 = 25%

### Recommended Margin of Safety

#### Benjamin Graham's Guidelines:
- **Minimum 33%**: For most investments
- **50% or more**: For speculative or uncertain situations
- **Lower margins**: Only for highest quality companies

#### Factors Affecting Required Margin:
- **Business quality**: Higher quality requires smaller margin
- **Valuation uncertainty**: Greater uncertainty requires larger margin
- **Market conditions**: Volatile markets require larger margins
- **Investor experience**: Less experienced investors need larger margins

### Risk Management Through Valuation

#### Downside Protection:
- **Asset backing**: Tangible book value provides floor
- **Dividend yield**: Income reduces downside risk
- **Financial strength**: Strong balance sheet limits bankruptcy risk
- **Multiple scenarios**: Consider various outcomes

#### Upside Potential:
- **Conservative assumptions**: Leave room for positive surprises
- **Multiple expansion**: P/E ratios can increase with improved sentiment
- **Growth acceleration**: Business improvements can exceed expectations
- **Special situations**: Spin-offs, restructuring, activist involvement

## Important Disclaimers

### Valuation Limitations and Risks

:::warning Important Disclaimers

**1. Estimates and Projections**
All valuation models rely on estimates and projections of future performance. These projections are inherently uncertain and may prove to be incorrect. Actual results may differ materially from projected values.

**2. Assumption Sensitivity**
Valuation results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used. Small changes in growth rates, discount rates, or other key variables can result in significantly different intrinsic value estimates.

**3. Market Efficiency Considerations**
Markets may remain irrational for extended periods. A stock trading below calculated intrinsic value may continue to decline or remain undervalued for longer than expected.

**4. Model Limitations**
No valuation model is perfect. Each method has inherent limitations and may not capture all relevant factors affecting a company's value.

**5. Historical Data Reliance**
Many valuation inputs are based on historical financial data, which may not be indicative of future performance, especially during periods of significant business or economic change.

**6. Professional Judgment Required**
Valuation is as much art as science. Professional judgment and experience are crucial for making appropriate assumptions and interpreting results.

**7. Not Investment Advice**
Valuation calculations should be used as one tool among many in making investment decisions. They do not constitute investment advice and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.

**8. Regular Updates Needed**
Valuations become outdated as new information becomes available. Regular updates are necessary to maintain relevance and accuracy.

:::

### Best Practices for Valuation

#### 1. Use Multiple Methods:
- **Cross-check results**: Compare different valuation approaches
- **Identify outliers**: Investigate significant differences between methods
- **Weight appropriately**: Give more weight to methods best suited for the company

#### 2. Conservative Assumptions:
- **Err on the side of caution**: Use conservative growth and margin assumptions
- **Stress test**: Consider downside scenarios
- **Margin of safety**: Require significant discount to calculated value

#### 3. Regular Updates:
- **Monitor changes**: Update valuations as new information becomes available
- **Quarterly reviews**: Reassess assumptions with each earnings report
- **Annual deep dive**: Comprehensive valuation review annually

#### 4. Document Assumptions:
- **Record reasoning**: Document why specific assumptions were chosen
- **Track accuracy**: Compare actual results to projections
- **Learn from errors**: Adjust methodology based on past mistakes

## Chapter Summary

Valuation is a critical skill for successful investing:

1. **Intrinsic value concept**: Understanding the difference between price and value
2. **Common ratios**: P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios for relative valuation
3. **Valuation models**: DDM, DCF, and asset-based approaches for absolute valuation
4. **Method selection**: Choosing appropriate techniques based on company characteristics
5. **Conservative assumptions**: Using realistic, well-supported projections
6. **Margin of safety**: Requiring significant discount to calculated value
7. **Limitations awareness**: Understanding the uncertainties and risks in valuation
8. **Regular updates**: Maintaining current valuations as conditions change

Remember that valuation is both an art and a science. While the mathematical formulas provide a framework, successful valuation requires judgment, experience, and a thorough understanding of the business being analyzed. Always use conservative assumptions, require a substantial margin of safety, and remember that all projections are estimates that may prove incorrect.

:::tip Key Takeaway
Master multiple valuation methods and always use conservative assumptions. The goal is not to calculate a precise intrinsic value, but rather to determine whether a stock offers an attractive risk-adjusted return opportunity. Focus on companies where you can make reasonable projections and always require a significant margin of safety to protect against valuation errors and market volatility.
