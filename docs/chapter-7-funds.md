# Chapter 7: Funds

Investment funds are pooled investment vehicles that allow multiple investors to combine their money and invest together in a diversified portfolio of securities. Instead of buying individual stocks, bonds, or REITs yourself, you can buy shares of a fund that owns hundreds or thousands of these investments.

## What Are Investment Funds?

An **investment fund** is a collection of money from many investors that is pooled together and managed by professional fund managers. When you invest in a fund, you're buying a small piece of a large, diversified portfolio.

### How Funds Work

#### The Pooling Concept
Think of a fund like a giant pizza that gets sliced into many pieces:
- **The pizza**: The fund's total portfolio of investments
- **Pizza slices**: Individual fund shares that investors buy
- **Pizza ingredients**: The stocks, bonds, or other securities the fund owns
- **Chef**: The fund manager who decides what to buy and sell

#### Fund Structure Example:
**Large Cap Stock Fund with \$1 Billion in Assets:**
- **10,000 investors** each contribute an average of \$100,000
- **Fund owns**: 200 different large company stocks
- **Each investor owns**: A proportional share of all 200 stocks
- **Professional management**: Fund managers make buy/sell decisions

### Benefits of Fund Investing

#### 1. Instant Diversification
- **Single purchase**: Own hundreds of securities with one transaction
- **Risk reduction**: Spread risk across many investments
- **Geographic diversification**: Access to global markets
- **Sector diversification**: Exposure to multiple industries

#### 2. Professional Management
- **Full-time expertise**: Professional fund managers and research teams
- **Resources**: Access to research, analysis tools, and market data
- **Experience**: Decades of investment experience
- **Monitoring**: Continuous portfolio oversight and rebalancing

#### 3. Economies of Scale
- **Lower costs**: Bulk trading reduces transaction costs
- **Negotiating power**: Better pricing on trades and services
- **Shared expenses**: Research and management costs spread across all investors
- **Minimum investments**: Access to investments normally requiring large minimums

#### 4. Liquidity and Convenience
- **Easy trading**: Buy and sell fund shares easily
- **Automatic reinvestment**: Dividends and capital gains can be reinvested
- **Regular statements**: Clear reporting of holdings and performance
- **Tax efficiency**: Professional tax management strategies

## Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) vs. Mutual Funds

Both ETFs and mutual funds are investment funds, but they have important structural differences that affect how you buy, sell, and own them.

### Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

**ETFs** are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks.

#### Key ETF Characteristics:

**Costs:**
- **Expense ratios**: Often higher than ETFs
- **Load fees**: Some funds charge sales fees (front-end or back-end)
- **12b-1 fees**: Marketing and distribution fees
- **Minimum investments**: Often \$1,000-\$3,000 minimum

#### Mutual Fund Example:

## Index Funds

**Index funds** are a special type of fund designed to track the performance of a specific market index rather than trying to beat it.

### What Are Index Funds?

#### Index Fund Concept:
- **Passive management**: No attempt to pick winners or time markets
- **Index tracking**: Owns the same securities as the target index
- **Proportional weighting**: Holds securities in same proportions as index
- **Low turnover**: Minimal buying and selling
- **Cost efficiency**: Very low management fees

#### How Index Funds Work:
1. **Choose an index**: S&P 500, Total Stock Market, etc.
2. **Buy all securities**: Purchase stocks in same proportions as index
3. **Automatic rebalancing**: Adjust holdings when index changes
4. **Dividend distribution**: Pass through dividends to fund shareholders
5. **Track performance**: Aim to match index returns minus small fees

### The S&P 500 Index

The **S&P 500** is the most popular index for U.S. stock market investing.

#### S&P 500 Composition:
- **500 companies**: Largest publicly traded U.S. companies
- **Market capitalization weighted**: Larger companies have bigger impact
- **Sector diversification**: Technology, healthcare, financials, etc.
- **Regular updates**: Companies added/removed based on criteria

#### S&P 500 Top Holdings (Example):
1. **Apple**: 7.1% of index
2. **Microsoft**: 6.8% of index
3. **Amazon**: 3.4% of index
4. **NVIDIA**: 3.1% of index
5. **Alphabet (Google)**: 3.0% of index

#### Market Cap Weighting Example:
$$\text{Company Weight} = \frac{\text{Company Market Cap}}{\text{Total Index Market Cap}} \times 100\%$$

**Apple Weight Calculation:**
- **Apple market cap**: \$3.0 trillion
- **S&P 500 total market cap**: \$42 trillion
- **Apple weight**: \$3.0T ÷ \$42T = 7.1%

### Why Index Funds Consistently Make Money (Especially in the US)

#### 3. Compound Returns

**The Power of Compounding:**
Index funds benefit from reinvesting dividends and capital gains, creating compound growth over time.

#### S&P 500 Compound Return Calculation:
$$\text{Future Value} = \text{Initial Investment} \times (1 + \text{Annual Return})^{\text{Years}}$$

**Example: 30-Year Investment:**
- **Initial investment**: \$10,000
- **Average annual return**: 10%
- **Time period**: 30 years

- **No load fees**: No sales charges
- **Low turnover**: Minimal trading costs
- **Tax efficiency**: Fewer taxable distributions

#### Cost Impact Over Time:
$$\text{Cost Impact} = \text{Investment} \times \text{Annual Fee} \times \text{Years}$$

**30-Year Cost Comparison:**
- **Index fund (0.05% fee)**: \$100,000 × 0.05% × 30 = \$1,500 total fees
- **Active fund (1.0% fee)**: \$100,000 × 1.0% × 30 = \$30,000 total fees
- **Difference**: \$28,500 more kept in index fund

## Index Fund Investment Strategies

### Dollar-Cost Averaging with Index Funds

**Dollar-cost averaging** involves investing a fixed amount regularly regardless of market conditions.

#### How Dollar-Cost Averaging Works:
1. **Set fixed amount**: Decide on monthly investment amount
2. **Regular schedule**: Invest same amount every month
3. **Ignore market timing**: Don't try to predict market movements
4. **Automatic investing**: Set up automatic transfers
5. **Long-term focus**: Continue for years or decades

#### Dollar-Cost Averaging Example:
**Monthly \$500 Investment in S&P 500 Index Fund:**

| Month | Investment | Share Price | Shares Bought | Total Shares |
|-------|------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Jan | \$500 | \$100 | 5.00 | 5.00 |
| Feb | \$500 | \$80 | 6.25 | 11.25 |
| Mar | \$500 | \$120 | 4.17 | 15.42 |
| Apr | \$500 | \$110 | 4.55 | 19.97 |

**Benefits:**
- **Reduces timing risk**: Don't need to predict best entry points
- **Smooths volatility**: Buy more shares when prices are low
- **Builds discipline**: Creates consistent investing habit
- **Emotional protection**: Removes emotion from investment decisions

### Target-Date Funds

**Target-date funds** automatically adjust asset allocation based on your expected retirement date.

#### How Target-Date Funds Work:
- **Age-based allocation**: More stocks when young, more bonds when older
- **Automatic rebalancing**: Gradually shifts to conservative investments
- **Professional management**: Fund managers handle all decisions
- **Single fund solution**: Complete portfolio in one fund

#### Target-Date Fund Example:
**Target-Date 2060 Fund (for someone retiring in 2060):**
- **Current allocation**: 90% stocks, 10% bonds
- **Age 40 allocation**: 80% stocks, 20% bonds
- **Age 55 allocation**: 65% stocks, 35% bonds
- **Age 65 allocation**: 40% stocks, 60% bonds

#### Glide Path Formula:
$$\text{Stock Allocation} = 100\% - \text{Age}$$

**Example for 30-year-old:**
- **Stock allocation**: 100% - 30 = 70%
- **Bond allocation**: 30%

### Three-Fund Portfolio

The **three-fund portfolio** is a simple, diversified approach using just three index funds.

#### Three-Fund Portfolio Components:
1. **Total Stock Market Index**: U.S. stock exposure
2. **International Stock Index**: Foreign stock exposure
3. **Bond Index**: Fixed income exposure

#### Sample Three-Fund Allocation:
**Conservative (Age 60):**
- **60% U.S. stocks**: Total Stock Market Index
- **20% International stocks**: International Index
- **20% Bonds**: Bond Index

**Moderate (Age 40):**
- **70% U.S. stocks**: Total Stock Market Index
- **20% International stocks**: International Index
- **10% Bonds**: Bond Index

**Aggressive (Age 25):**
- **80% U.S. stocks**: Total Stock Market Index
- **20% International stocks**: International Index
- **0% Bonds**: No bond allocation

## Key Formulas Summary

### Fund Expense Ratio Impact
$$\text{Annual Fee} = \text{Investment Amount} \times \text{Expense Ratio}$$

### Compound Growth
$$\text{Future Value} = \text{Initial Investment} \times (1 + \text{Annual Return})^{\text{Years}}$$

### Index Weight Calculation
$$\text{Company Weight} = \frac{\text{Company Market Cap}}{\text{Total Index Market Cap}} \times 100\%$$

### Dollar-Cost Average Price
$$\text{Average Price} = \frac{\text{Total Amount Invested}}{\text{Total Shares Purchased}}$$

### Asset Allocation by Age
$$\text{Stock Allocation} = 100\% - \text{Age}$$
