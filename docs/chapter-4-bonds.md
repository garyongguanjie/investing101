## What is a Bond?

A **bond** is essentially an IOU - a loan that you make to a government, corporation, or other entity. When you buy a bond, you are lending money to the issuer in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of your principal when the bond matures.

### Key Components of a Bond

#### Principal (Face Value)
- The amount the bond will pay back when it matures
- Also called "par value" or "face value"
- Typically \$1,000 for corporate bonds

#### Maturity Date
- When the bond expires and the principal is repaid
- Can range from a few months to 30+ years
- **Short-term**: Less than 3 years
- **Medium-term**: 3-10 years
- **Long-term**: More than 10 years

#### Coupon Rate
- The annual interest rate the bond pays
- Usually expressed as a percentage of face value
- **Example**: A 5% coupon rate on a \$1,000 bond pays \$50 per year

#### Coupon Payments
- Regular interest payments (usually semi-annual)
- **Example**: A \$1,000 bond with 5% coupon pays \$25 every 6 months

### How Bonds Work: A Simple Example

**You buy a 10-year corporate bond:**
- **Face Value**: \$1,000
- **Coupon Rate**: 4%
- **Purchase Price**: \$1,000

**What happens:**
1. You pay \$1,000 today
2. You receive \$40 per year (4% of \$1,000) in interest payments
3. After 10 years, you get your \$1,000 back
4. **Total return**: \$400 in interest + \$1,000 principal = \$1,400

## Types of Bonds

### Government Bonds
- **Issued by**: Federal, state, or local governments
- **Risk Level**: Generally low (especially federal government)
- **Examples**: U.S. Treasury bonds, municipal bonds
- **Tax Benefits**: Some government bonds offer tax advantages

### Corporate Bonds
- **Issued by**: Companies to raise capital
- **Risk Level**: Varies by company's financial strength
- **Higher Yields**: Typically pay more than government bonds
- **Credit Risk**: Company could default on payments

### International Bonds
- **Issued by**: Foreign governments or companies
- **Currency Risk**: Exchange rate fluctuations affect returns
- **Diversification**: Provides geographic diversification

## Coupon Rate vs Yield

Understanding the difference between coupon rate and yield is crucial for bond investing.

### Coupon Rate
- **Definition**: The fixed annual interest rate stated on the bond
- **Never changes**: Remains constant throughout the bond's life
- **Based on face value**: Always calculated on the original \$1,000 face value

### Current Yield
The current yield shows the annual return based on the bond's current market price.

#### Current Yield Formula:
$$\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Current Market Price}}$$

#### Example Calculation:
- **Bond**: \$1,000 face value, 5% coupon rate
- **Annual coupon**: \$50
- **Current market price**: \$950

$$\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{\$50}}{\text{\$950}} = 0.0526 = 5.26\%$$

### Yield to Maturity (YTM)
**Yield to Maturity** is the total return you'll receive if you hold the bond until it matures. It considers:
- All coupon payments
- The difference between purchase price and face value
- The time remaining until maturity

#### YTM Concept:
YTM is the interest rate that makes the present value of all future cash flows equal to the bond's current price. While the full calculation is complex, YTM gives you the true annual return if held to maturity.

**Key Point**: YTM is more accurate than current yield because it accounts for capital gains or losses when the bond matures.

## Credit Ratings

Credit ratings assess the likelihood that a bond issuer will repay their debt. These ratings help investors understand the risk level of different bonds.

### Major Rating Agencies
- **Standard & Poor's (S&P)**
- **Moody's**
- **Fitch Ratings**

### Rating Scale (S&P System)

#### Investment Grade (Lower Risk)
- **AAA**: Highest quality, extremely low default risk
- **AA**: High quality, very low default risk
- **A**: Upper-medium grade, low default risk
- **BBB**: Medium grade, moderate default risk

#### Non-Investment Grade (Higher Risk)
- **BB**: Speculative, higher default risk
- **B**: Highly speculative, significant default risk
- **CCC**: Substantial default risk
- **CC**: Very high default risk
- **C**: Extremely speculative
- **D**: In default

### Risk vs Return by Rating

| Rating | Risk Level | Typical Yield |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| AAA    | Very Low   | 2-3%          |
| AA     | Low        | 2.5-3.5%      |
| A      | Low-Medium | 3-4%          |
| BBB    | Medium     | 3.5-4.5%      |
| BB     | Medium-High| 4.5-6%        |
| B      | High       | 6-8%          |
| CCC    | Very High  | 8%+           |

:::tip Investment Strategy
Most conservative investors stick to investment-grade bonds (BBB and above) for the core of their bond portfolio, while more aggressive investors might allocate a small portion to high-yield bonds for potentially higher returns.

## How Bond Yields Affect Bond Prices

One of the most important concepts in bond investing is the **inverse relationship** between bond yields and bond prices.

### The Fundamental Rule
**When interest rates (yields) go up, bond prices go down.**
**When interest rates (yields) go down, bond prices go up.**

### Why This Happens

#### Scenario 1: Interest Rates Rise
**Initial situation:**
- You own a bond paying 4% coupon
- New bonds are issued paying 6% coupon

**Market reaction:**
- Your 4% bond becomes less attractive
- Investors prefer the new 6% bonds
- Your bond's price falls to make its yield competitive

#### Scenario 2: Interest Rates Fall
**Initial situation:**
- You own a bond paying 6% coupon
- New bonds are issued paying 4% coupon

**Market reaction:**
- Your 6% bond becomes more attractive
- Investors want your higher-yielding bond
- Your bond's price rises

### Practical Example

**Bond Details:**
- Face value: \$1,000
- Coupon rate: 5% (pays \$50 annually)
- Original price: \$1,000

#### When Interest Rates Rise to 6%:
- New bonds pay 6% (\$60 annually)
- Your bond paying \$50 must drop in price
- **New price**: approximately \$833
- **Current yield**: \$50 รท \$833 = 6% (competitive again)

#### When Interest Rates Fall to 4%:
- New bonds pay only 4% (\$40 annually)
- Your bond paying \$50 becomes valuable
- **New price**: approximately \$1,250
- **Current yield**: \$50 รท \$1,250 = 4% (market rate)

### Duration Risk

**Duration** measures how sensitive a bond's price is to interest rate changes.

#### Key Points:
- **Longer maturity = Higher duration = More price sensitivity**
- **Shorter maturity = Lower duration = Less price sensitivity**
- **Higher coupon rate = Lower duration**

#### Example:
- **30-year bond**: Might lose 15-20% value if rates rise 1%
- **2-year bond**: Might lose only 2-3% value if rates rise 1%

## Bond Investment Strategies

### Buy and Hold
- Purchase bonds and hold until maturity
- **Advantage**: Guaranteed return of principal at maturity
- **Disadvantage**: Locked into current rates

### Bond Laddering
- Buy bonds with different maturity dates
- **Example**: Buy 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, and 5-year bonds
- **Advantage**: Reduces interest rate risk and provides regular cash flow

### Active Trading
- Buy and sell bonds based on interest rate predictions
- **Higher risk**: Requires accurate market timing
- **Potential for capital gains**: Can profit from price movements

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Bonds

### Advantages
1. **Steady Income**: Regular, predictable coupon payments
2. **Capital Preservation**: Principal returned at maturity (if held to maturity)
3. **Diversification**: Often move differently than stocks
4. **Lower Volatility**: Generally less risky than stocks
5. **Tax Benefits**: Some bonds offer tax advantages

### Disadvantages
1. **Interest Rate Risk**: Bond prices fall when rates rise
2. **Inflation Risk**: Fixed payments lose purchasing power over time
3. **Credit Risk**: Issuer might default
4. **Lower Returns**: Historically lower returns than stocks over long periods
5. **Liquidity Risk**: Some bonds may be hard to sell before maturity

## Key Formulas Summary

### Current Yield
$$\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Current Market Price}}$$

### Approximate Yield to Maturity (Simplified)
While the exact YTM calculation is complex, this approximation helps understand the concept:

$$\text{Approximate YTM} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon} + \frac{\text{Face Value} - \text{Current Price}}{\text{Years to Maturity}}}{\frac{\text{Face Value} + \text{Current Price}}{2}}$$

### Bond Price Sensitivity (Duration Approximation)
$$\text{Price Change \%} \approx -\text{Duration} \times \text{Interest Rate Change}$$

## Chapter Summary

Bonds are essential building blocks of a diversified portfolio:

1. **What bonds are**: Loans you make to governments or corporations
2. **Coupon vs Yield**: Coupon rate is fixed; yields change with market conditions
3. **Credit ratings**: Help assess default risk from AAA (safest) to D (default)
4. **Price-yield relationship**: Bond prices move opposite to interest rates
5. **Key formula**: Current Yield = Annual Coupon รท Current Price

Understanding these concepts will help you make informed decisions about including bonds in your investment portfolio. In the next chapter, we'll explore how to build a balanced portfolio using different asset classes including bonds.

:::tip Remember
Bonds provide stability and income to your portfolio, but they're not risk-free. Interest rate changes, inflation, and credit risk all affect bond investments. The key is understanding these risks and how they fit into your overall investment strategy.
